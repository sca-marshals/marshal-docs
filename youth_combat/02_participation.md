# Participation
Any youth desiring to participate in youth combat shall have a responsible adult assume all risks and liabilities for any harm or medical condition arising from the youth’s participation in these activities. The assumption of responsibility shall be signified by all legal documents required by the SCA and their resident kingdom. For the purposes of youth combat a responsible adult is defined as the youth’s parent or court-appointed legal guardian.

No youth shall participate in youth combat unless the responsible adult has completed a “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” form. This form is submitted to the local seneschal who will forward it to the Kingdom Waiver Secretary.  The minor should also have a copy of this form with him/her at all times.

Youths may not participate in tournaments or large melees unless first authorized for youth combat using the procedures of their resident kingdom. They may practice or engage in small scale melees of 12 fighters or less prior to authorizing.
