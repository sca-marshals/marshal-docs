## Javelins
Javelins made of one diameter PEX or Siloflex may be used in melee combat in Divisions 2 and 3. They may be thrown or be used as a single-handed thrusting weapon.

1) The thrusting tip must conform to standard weapon thrusting tips.
2) The butt end may not be used offensively. It must be padded with foam in such a manner that it will not penetrate a 2 inch opening.
3) Javelins must be between 4 and 5 Â½ feet long.
4) Fins or stabilizers of foam or duct tape may be attached near the backend.
5) Calibration level for a THROWN javelin is intentional touch.
6) Calibration level for a javelin used as a one-handed thrusting weapon is the same as any weapon appropriate for that division.
7) Face thrusts are legal for thrown javelins.
