## Division 2
1. The principle core material for all weapons is rattan with a diameter between Â¾ and 1 inch. One inch diameter PEX or Siloflex may also be used as a core material, but both ends must be capped with leather, unbreakable plastic, or similar material. Given the excessive flexibility of PEX or Siloflex in warm temperatures it is recommended that these cores be limited to single-handed weapons.
2. Both ends shall be rounded and/or capped with cloth or leather to prevent the rattan from cutting through the foam.
3. Butt spikes are permitted on two-handed weapons.
4. Spears are not permitted in Division 2.
5. All weapons must be proportional to the combatant. No weapons may be longer than 5.5 feet.
