# Parental Involvement
1. Youth Combat is NOT a babysitting service.
2. Parents/guardians have the right to remove their child from any contest or activity which they may deem inappropriate or hazardous.
3. At least one parent/guardian must be present at the lists at all times for Division 1 fighters (ages 6 to 9).
4. At least one parent/guardian must be on the site where youth combat is taking place at all times for Division 2 fighters (ages 10 to 13).
5. A parent/guardian of a Division 3 fighter (ages 14 to 17) must have the program and rules explained to them during the minor’s first visit to an SCA youth combat function. After this they may designate an adult to be responsible for the minor at an SCA function. However, in addition to the “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” form, a copy of the “Medical Authorization for Minors” form must be on file with the kingdom waiver secretary. A copy of this form must also accompany the minor. Parents should be available via electronic communications (e.g.- cell phone) in the event of an emergency.
6. Adults watching youth combat activities shall act in a courteous manner toward the combatants, marshals, youth combat officials, and other parents. Jeering and heckling your child’s opponent is NOT acceptable. Adults demonstrating bad behavior will be asked to leave the youth combat area. This may result in their child having to withdraw from that day’s activity.
7. Youth Combatants must either have a current signed blue membership card or have their parent/guardian execute a “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” in order to participate in every practice, event, demo, or war. This form must be forwarded to the kingdom Waiver Secretary by the local seneschal.
