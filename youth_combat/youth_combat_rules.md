# Society Youth Combat Rules

May 2012

# Overview
Youth Combat is a program designed for minors ages 6 to 17. This program emphasizes armor and weapon construction techniques, proper etiquette, the concepts of Chivalry, Honor, and Courtesy, teamwork and good sportsmanship, and effective fighting arts in a competitive environment that parallels Adult Armored Combat. It is not intended as a substitute for normal play.

# Participation
Any youth desiring to participate in youth combat shall have a responsible adult assume all risks and liabilities for any harm or medical condition arising from the youth’s participation in these activities. The assumption of responsibility shall be signified by all legal documents required by the SCA and their resident kingdom. For the purposes of youth combat a responsible adult is defined as the youth’s parent or court-appointed legal guardian.

No youth shall participate in youth combat unless the responsible adult has completed a “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” form. This form is submitted to the local seneschal who will forward it to the Kingdom Waiver Secretary.  The minor should also have a copy of this form with him/her at all times.

Youths may not participate in tournaments or large melees unless first authorized for youth combat using the procedures of their resident kingdom. They may practice or engage in small scale melees of 12 fighters or less prior to authorizing.

# Parental Involvement
1. Youth Combat is NOT a babysitting service.
2. Parents/guardians have the right to remove their child from any contest or activity which they may deem inappropriate or hazardous.
3. At least one parent/guardian must be present at the lists at all times for Division 1 fighters (ages 6 to 9).
4. At least one parent/guardian must be on the site where youth combat is taking place at all times for Division 2 fighters (ages 10 to 13).
5. A parent/guardian of a Division 3 fighter (ages 14 to 17) must have the program and rules explained to them during the minor’s first visit to an SCA youth combat function. After this they may designate an adult to be responsible for the minor at an SCA function. However, in addition to the “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” form, a copy of the “Medical Authorization for Minors” form must be on file with the kingdom waiver secretary. A copy of this form must also accompany the minor. Parents should be available via electronic communications (e.g.- cell phone) in the event of an emergency.
6. Adults watching youth combat activities shall act in a courteous manner toward the combatants, marshals, youth combat officials, and other parents. Jeering and heckling your child’s opponent is NOT acceptable. Adults demonstrating bad behavior will be asked to leave the youth combat area. This may result in their child having to withdraw from that day’s activity.
7. Youth Combatants must either have a current signed blue membership card or have their parent/guardian execute a “Minor’s Consent to Participate and Hold Harmless Agreement” in order to participate in every practice, event, demo, or war. This form must be forwarded to the kingdom Waiver Secretary by the local seneschal.

# Rules of the List
1. All combatants shall act in a courteous and chivalrous manner at all times.
2. The instructions of the marshal shall be followed at all times. Should a safety issue arise the marshal will call “HOLD” and all combat activity in the list will stop until the marshal indicates that it is safe to resume.
3. A fighter shall not take deliberate advantage of an opponent’s safety or chivalry.  This includes:

    1. Walking around an opponent who has lost the use of his legs (corkscrewing).
    2. Hitting an opponent from behind.
    3. Hitting an opponent who cannot defend himself (e.g.- laying on the ground).
    4. Continually dropping a weapon or running into the list ropes.
    5. Grappling.
    6. Shield on body contact.
    7. Hitting with excessive force.
    8. Using a weapon in a manner for which it was not intended.
    9. Refusing to acknowledge blows.
    10. Shield on shield contact for the purpose of unbalancing or knocking down an opponent (shield bashing).
    11. Throwing or launching weapons at an opponent in the list. (Javelins may be thrown in melee combat.)

# Youth Combat Authorizations
Kingdoms may use whatever system they prefer for authorizations as long as the following criteria are met:

1. At least one Adult Youth Combat Marshal must witness and approve the authorization.
2. Youth combatants must demonstrate their knowledge of the rules of Youth Combat.
3. Youth combatants must demonstrate that they can safely spar with other youths.
4. They must be able to effectively block shots.
5. They must be able to consistently throw shots at the appropriate level of calibration to legal target areas.
6. Kingdoms must provide documentation in the form of a card/document which shows that the youth is authorized to engage in youth combat in his or her Division. This card/document must be shown to youth combat officials before a youth combatant engages in youth combat activities including tournaments and melees.
7. A youth combatant who permanently moves up a Division must reauthorize.

# Marshals
Kingdoms may use whatever methods they deem appropriate to warrant marshals including, but not limited to marshal classes and marshal-in-training programs.  

All marshals shall know the Youth Combat Rules. They should be able to supervise youth combatants both in the lists and in melee combat. They should promote safe practices and enforce the rules of the list. They should be able to inspect weapons and armor. They should be able to authorize youth combatants according to the rules of their kingdom. All marshals must have a current blue signed SCA membership card, or have signed an Adult waiver form, and also have proof that they have been warranted by their kingdom to marshal youth combat (e.g.-warrant card).

There are four levels of youth combat marshals:

1. BC Adult Youth Combat Marshal- These are marshals who have been warranted by their kingdom and have passed a current SCA background check. All Youth Combat Marshals do NOT have to have an SCA background check, however each area of youth combat activities must have somebody present who has passed a current SCA background check. Further information on background checks may be found in the SCA Youth Policies.
2. Adult Youth Combat Marshals- These are marshals who have been warranted by their kingdom, but have not submitted an SCA background check. They are fully warranted marshals, but must have somebody present (not necessarily a marshal) who has a current SCA background check.
3. Adult Youth Combat Sparring Marshals- These are adult warranted marshals who have been warranted by their kingdom to spar with youth combatants. They must use weapons, armor, and calibration levels appropriate to the Division of the youth combatant with whom they are sparring. Parents can always spar with their own children. Adults may not participate in youth combat tournaments or melees.
4. Limited Marshals-This includes minor marshals (ages 12 to 17) and marshals-in- training. Theses marshals may perform all of they duties of a warranted marshal, but must be supervised by a BC Adult Youth Combat Marshal or Adult Youth Combat Marshal. Additionally, kingdoms may elect to have “line marshals” who work under the supervision of a BC Adult Youth Combat Marshal or Youth Combat Marshal. Line marshals do not perform inspections or conduct authorizations, but provide an “extra set of eyes” in the lists during tournaments or during melees.

# Marshaling
1. All SCA youth combat activities including practices, events, demos, and wars must have at least one BC Adult Youth Combat Marshal or an Adult Youth Combat Marshal and an adult who has a current SCA background check supervising the activities in each youth combat area at all times.
2. In accordance with the Society Youth Policy’s “Two-Deep Rule” at least 2 adults not related to each other must be present in each area where youths are engaged in youth combat activities.
3. Marshals shall make sure that all armor and equipment is inspected and safe to use.
4. Marshals shall monitor activities and behavior on the field and immediately stop all potentially hazardous or unchivalrous activities by calling “HOLD”.

# Melee Rules
1. An opponent may not be struck from behind, but their weapon maybe “fouled”.
2. Fighters may only charge to gain ground. They may not intentionally run into their opponents.
3. Fighters who have fallen down may not be struck. They must be allowed to rise and defend themselves before they may be struck.
4. Holds will not be called for dropped weapons unless dropping the weapon compromises the safety of the fighter. For example, if dropping a sword with a basket hilt compromises the safety of the fighter’s hand.
5. One of two options may be used during melees- Recognition or Death From Behind. Either, but not both methods may be used during a melee. Fighters and marshals should know before the melee begins which is being used and the rules for that method.
    1. With Recognition, a fighter must have visual contact with his opponent before striking him. A fighter may not look away or avoid eye contact for the purposes of avoiding recognition.
    2. With Death From Behind, a fighter must place their weapon on their opponent’s shoulder and announce in a loud, clear voice “You are dead from behind”.

# Reporting
Youth Combat is a subsidiary of Armored Combat. Kingdom Youth Combat Marshals should report their activities to their Kingdom Earl Marshal with three exceptions.

1. Any progress reports about using pre-approved experimental weapons should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat.
2. An incident involving serious injury to a youth fighter should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat as well as the Kingdom Earl Marshal. A serious injury is something which involves emergency medical treatment or hospitalization.
3. Incidents of inappropriate behavior by a youth combatant or participating adult which is serious enough to warrant revoked authorization, warrant, a court of chivalry, possible banishment, or legal action should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat as well as the Kingdom Earl Marshal. A copy of this report will be forwarded to the Society Special Deputy for Family and Youth Programs.

# Age Divisions
There are three age divisions:
* Division 1- Ages 6 to 9
* Division 2- Ages 10 to 13
* Division 3- Ages 14 to 17

## Crossing Divisions

Younger combatants may permanently move to a higher division with the approval of the combatant’s parent/guardian and the Kingdom Youth Combat Marshal or a representative designated by the Kingdom Youth Combat Marshal.

Acknowledging the fact that there might be a limited number of youth combatants at an event or practice, combatants may fight others in another division with the following provisions:

    1. Permission of the combatant’s parent/guardian.
    2. Permission of the youth combat marshal-in-charge.
    3. Older combatants must adhere to the weapon standards, calibration, and rules of the younger combatants being fought (e.g.- Division 3 combatants must fight a Division 1 combatant at the Division 1 level).

# Youth Rattan
A number of kingdoms have programs with youth combatants under 18 years of age using adult rattan weapons and armor. Given that local, state, and national laws can very greatly as to the nature of minors participating in full contact marshal activities, kingdoms may institute their own programs in regard to youth combatants fighting under adult rattan combat rules. However, all SCA armored combat conventions and rules must be adhered to at a minimum.

A kingdom may elect to allow youth combatants who are currently fighting in adult rattan combat to fight Division 3 youth combatants using Division 3 weapons and calibration.  However, these combatants may NOT fight Division 1 or 2 opponents. In all cases, youth combatants who display a consistent lack of control or good conduct may be removed from the field and/or have their authorizations suspended.

# Calibration
* Division 1- Intentional Touch- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which is readily felt threw a single layer of medium weight cloth, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise on bare skin. No face thrusts.
* Division 2- Positive Force- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which is readily felt through ¼ inch of open cell padding, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise in an area covered by medium weight cloth. Face thrusts have touch calibration.
* Division 3- Light Force- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which may be readily felt through ½ inch of open cell padding, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise through ¼ of open cell foam padding. Face thrusts have touch calibration.

It is recommended that marshals use open cell foam of the appropriate thickness to demonstrate levels of calibration.

Excessive blows are not permitted in any Division. Any combatant who persists in hitting too hard after appropriate warning may be removed from the field and/or have their authorization suspended.

# Targeting
“Edged weapons” must strike with the “blade” in order to be considered good.  Legal target areas are the same as those in adult rattan combat. A good blow is one inch above the wrist results in the loss of that arm. A good blow is one inch above the knee results in the loss of that leg. A good blow the torso, neck or head results in the opponent being “killed”. Shots to the groin and throat are legal, but discouraged. Face thrusts are not allowed in Division 1.

Alternative formats maybe used to determine victory such as counted blows or first blood provided that the combatants know and understand the format being used.

# Armor Requirements
These are minimum required armor standards. A kingdom may require that additional armor be worn. While it is the goal of the SCA to encourage a medieval appearance for all participants given the specific nature of youth combat, visible modern sports equipment may be worn as armor.

## Armor Requirements (All Divisions)
###  Head
Helmets must completely cover the head. Hockey helmets, lacrosse helmets, and catcher’s helmets with face masks are acceptable. They may have to have additions or alterations to fully enclose the head.
