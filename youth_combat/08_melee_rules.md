# Melee Rules
1. An opponent may not be struck from behind, but their weapon maybe “fouled”.
2. Fighters may only charge to gain ground. They may not intentionally run into their opponents.
3. Fighters who have fallen down may not be struck. They must be allowed to rise and defend themselves before they may be struck.
4. Holds will not be called for dropped weapons unless dropping the weapon compromises the safety of the fighter. For example, if dropping a sword with a basket hilt compromises the safety of the fighter’s hand.
5. One of two options may be used during melees- Recognition or Death From Behind. Either, but not both methods may be used during a melee. Fighters and marshals should know before the melee begins which is being used and the rules for that method.
    1. With Recognition, a fighter must have visual contact with his opponent before striking him. A fighter may not look away or avoid eye contact for the purposes of avoiding recognition.
    2. With Death From Behind, a fighter must place their weapon on their opponent’s shoulder and announce in a loud, clear voice “You are dead from behind”.
