# Reporting
Youth Combat is a subsidiary of Armored Combat. Kingdom Youth Combat Marshals should report their activities to their Kingdom Earl Marshal with three exceptions.

1. Any progress reports about using pre-approved experimental weapons should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat.
2. An incident involving serious injury to a youth fighter should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat as well as the Kingdom Earl Marshal. A serious injury is something which involves emergency medical treatment or hospitalization.
3. Incidents of inappropriate behavior by a youth combatant or participating adult which is serious enough to warrant revoked authorization, warrant, a court of chivalry, possible banishment, or legal action should be reported to the Society Deputy for Youth Combat as well as the Kingdom Earl Marshal. A copy of this report will be forwarded to the Society Special Deputy for Family and Youth Programs.
