# Youth Combat Authorizations
Kingdoms may use whatever system they prefer for authorizations as long as the following criteria are met:

1. At least one Adult Youth Combat Marshal must witness and approve the authorization.
2. Youth combatants must demonstrate their knowledge of the rules of Youth Combat.
3. Youth combatants must demonstrate that they can safely spar with other youths.
4. They must be able to effectively block shots.
5. They must be able to consistently throw shots at the appropriate level of calibration to legal target areas.
6. Kingdoms must provide documentation in the form of a card/document which shows that the youth is authorized to engage in youth combat in his or her Division. This card/document must be shown to youth combat officials before a youth combatant engages in youth combat activities including tournaments and melees.
7. A youth combatant who permanently moves up a Division must reauthorize.
