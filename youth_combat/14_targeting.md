# Targeting
“Edged weapons” must strike with the “blade” in order to be considered good.  Legal target areas are the same as those in adult rattan combat. A good blow is one inch above the wrist results in the loss of that arm. A good blow is one inch above the knee results in the loss of that leg. A good blow the torso, neck or head results in the opponent being “killed”. Shots to the groin and throat are legal, but discouraged. Face thrusts are not allowed in Division 1.

Alternative formats maybe used to determine victory such as counted blows or first blood provided that the combatants know and understand the format being used.
