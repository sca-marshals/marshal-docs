# Calibration
* Division 1- Intentional Touch- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which is readily felt threw a single layer of medium weight cloth, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise on bare skin. No face thrusts.
* Division 2- Positive Force- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which is readily felt through ¼ inch of open cell padding, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise in an area covered by medium weight cloth. Face thrusts have touch calibration.
* Division 3- Light Force- This is a clean, unimpeded blow which may be readily felt through ½ inch of open cell padding, but is not hard enough to leave a bruise through ¼ of open cell foam padding. Face thrusts have touch calibration.

It is recommended that marshals use open cell foam of the appropriate thickness to demonstrate levels of calibration.

Excessive blows are not permitted in any Division. Any combatant who persists in hitting too hard after appropriate warning may be removed from the field and/or have their authorization suspended.
