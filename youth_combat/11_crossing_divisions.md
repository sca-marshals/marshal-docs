## Crossing Divisions

Younger combatants may permanently move to a higher division with the approval of the combatant’s parent/guardian and the Kingdom Youth Combat Marshal or a representative designated by the Kingdom Youth Combat Marshal.

Acknowledging the fact that there might be a limited number of youth combatants at an event or practice, combatants may fight others in another division with the following provisions:

1. Permission of the combatant’s parent/guardian.
2. Permission of the youth combat marshal-in-charge.
3. Older combatants must adhere to the weapon standards, calibration, and rules of the younger combatants being fought (e.g.- Division 3 combatants must fight a Division 1 combatant at the Division 1 level).
