###  Head
Helmets must completely cover the head. Hockey helmets, lacrosse helmets, and catcherâ€™s helmets with face masks are acceptable. They may have to have additions or alterations to fully enclose the head. Period looking helms are permitted, but bearing in mind the size and development of the youth the marshal-in-charge may disallow the use of a helm deemed too heavy for the youth to wear safely.

1. All helmets must have grills, rigid mesh, or face plates which prevent a weapon from making contact with the face. No helmet shall a gap exceeding 2 inches in the area protecting the face.
2. The helmet must be constructed of a continuous rigid material. Segmented or jointed helmets are not permitted. Helmets may have hanging aventails, camails, or bevors to aid in protecting the neck.
3. Helmets must have a chin strap or back strap to hold it securely on the head.
4. Helmets must be padded inside so that the rigid portions of it do not contact the head.
5. Helmets must fit properly.
6. Helmets in conjunction with neck protection (such as a gorget) must be constructed so that a weapon may not touch any exposed area of the head or neck.
