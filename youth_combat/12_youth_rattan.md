# Youth Rattan
A number of kingdoms have programs with youth combatants under 18 years of age using adult rattan weapons and armor. Given that local, state, and national laws can very greatly as to the nature of minors participating in full contact marshal activities, kingdoms may institute their own programs in regard to youth combatants fighting under adult rattan combat rules. However, all SCA armored combat conventions and rules must be adhered to at a minimum.

A kingdom may elect to allow youth combatants who are currently fighting in adult rattan combat to fight Division 3 youth combatants using Division 3 weapons and calibration.  However, these combatants may NOT fight Division 1 or 2 opponents. In all cases, youth combatants who display a consistent lack of control or good conduct may be removed from the field and/or have their authorizations suspended.
