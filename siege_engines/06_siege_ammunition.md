## Siege Ammunition
1. No siege engine ammunition may exceed 1 pound in weight.
2. Siege Class Munitions (1-pound foam-filled rocks, 4-tennis-ball rocks, and 48-inch ballista bolts) must be colored with yellow tape in the following manners to denote them as Siege Class Munitions. Rocks, both 1-pound foam and 4-tennis-ball, must have at least 50% of their surfaces covered with yellow tape. Ballista bolts made with Siloflex that is not yellow in color must have their shafts and striking surfaces covered completely with yellow tape. These munitions may not be fired from small arms or thrown by hand.
3. Ammunition shall be constructed of the following materials:
    1. Open-cell or closed-cell foam.
    2. Tennis balls. Tennis balls may be punctured with a hole, not to exceed 1/16th of an inch in diameter, to relieve internal pressure. When used as the striking surface of a ballista bolt, tennis balls must be compressible by hand with no less than ½ inch of compression and no more than 1 inch of compression.
    3. Golf tubes or Siloflex. Siloflex must meet the following standards: for pipe that is black in color, it must be manufactured to ASTM D2239 or D2737; be made from PE3408; be sized 1"ID if D2239 or 1¼"OD if D2737; and have a SIDR rating of 15 or lower or have a SODR rating of 17 or lower. For pipe that is yellow in color, it must be manufactured to ASTM D2513; made from PE 2406; be 1"IPS; and have an SDR of 11. (Please note that shafts made from yellow Siloflex may not be covered with tape, and the markings must be visible)
    4. Cord.
    5. Duct and filament tape.
    6. Film canisters.
    7. PVC reinforcement rings. Rings may not exceed 2 inches in length. Missile shafts may not be made from PVC.
    8. Leather.
    9. Lightweight fabric such as broadcloth, trigger, or similar material.
4. Large siege ammunition is intended to simulate large, heavy projectiles normally used as anti-structure missiles (e.g., 250-pound sandstone rocks used in the largest of engines). These missiles are simulated with 1-pound “rocks.” 1-pound rocks shall:
    1. Be constructed of fabric spheres filled with light-density foam and taped with filament and duct tape for protection.
    2. Be a minimum of 6½ inches in diameter.
5. Small siege ammunition is intended to simulate smaller, lighter projectiles used as light anti-structure and antipersonnel missiles (e.g., ballista javelins and 10-pound stones as used in Perriers). Permissible small siege projectiles include:
    1. 4-tennis-ball clusters secured with filament tape and duct tape (punctured and tied with cord also acceptable).
    2. Spliced golf tube javelins. Splices must be secured with cord and/or filament tape. Striking tips may be either a single tennis ball, tied on and taped with filament and duct tape, or a thrusting tip with a minimum of 3 inches of foam between the striking surface and the end of the javelin and a minimum diameter of 2½ inches. It must have at least 1 inch of progressive give and cannot bottom on the tube. Additionally, the end of the tube must be capped with a minimum of 1/8-inch heavy leather or a 35mm film container securely held in place with filament tape. The tubes may be reinforced with medium-density foam, such as pipe insulation, in order to prevent crush damage. Film canisters, PVC rings (no more than 2 inches long), and similar non-brittle, nonmetallic, lightweight reinforcements (securely attached) may be used at the butt end of the javelin.  Non-rigid fletching may be used. Javelins will be at least 48 inches and clearly marked with yellow tape for the length of the shaft.
    3. Other javelins. Materials such as Siloflex or similar semi-rigid, shatter-resistant tubing can be used, as long as the minimum diameter is equivalent to a golf tube and the rest of the construction meets the standards for spliced tube construction.
6. Specialty siege ammunition is intended to simulate specialty ammunition (e.g., flaming oil pots or flaming javelins) or effect weapons (e.g., diseased animal corpses or the heads of decapitated messengers). Specialty missiles will have damage determined in the scenario rules. Most effect weapons will have little or no damage potential, and therefore should be used sparingly. Specialty siege ammunition may be used as long as it does not exceed the weight or construction limitations of the approved ammunitions.
