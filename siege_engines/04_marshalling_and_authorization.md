## Marshalling and Authorization
1.  Each Kingdom shall report its activities involving siege to the Society Earl Marshal’s Deputy for Siege on a quarterly basis. Any injury resulting from siege activities and requiring professional medical attention will be reported to the Society Earl Marshal immediately after the event where it occurred. It is recommended that each Kingdom Earl Marshal appoint a deputy to fulfill these duties and to oversee the Kingdom Siege Program.
2. Siege Engineer Authorization
    1. Each Kingdom will have a separate authorization procedure for any person wishing to operate or crew a siege engine. This authorization at a minimum shall include:
        1. Demonstration of knowledge of the rules for melee combat
        2. Demonstration of understanding the rules for siege
        3. Demonstration of ability to safely operate an engine
        4. Demonstration of ability to inspect engine for safety
        5. Demonstration of ability to render engine safe, should the need arise
        6. Understanding of how engines/engineers are killed by opponents
        7. It is RECOMMENDED that engineers be observed for at least 1 battle before authorizations are made final.
3. Marshalling Siege Combat
    1. Marshals trained in siege activities will oversee the inspection of engines and operators and will be present on any field where siege engines are in use.  During combat there will be a minimum of 1 Siege Marshal for each end of the field that has a siege engine. It is recommended that there be 1 Siege Marshal for every 3 engines in use.
    2. All Siege Marshals shall:
        1. Be members of the Society for Creative Anachronism
        2. Be authorized in siege combat, or have gone through a siege marshal training program within their Kingdom
        3. Have a basic understanding of all major engine types (Ballista/Arbalest, Catapult/Onager, Trebuchet [both counterweight and man-powered])
        4. Know how to inspect engines and ammunition
        5. Know the current siege engine regulation
    3. In addition to these requirements, Siege Marshals on the field shall:
        1. Have at least 1 year or 4 events of experience as an engineer, or have completed an appropriate training program within their Kingdom
        2. Know the basics of armored combat marshaling (see Marshal’s Handbook) and conduct themselves safely on the field. (Being a warranted armored combat marshal is recommended but not required.)
    4. Marshals on the field within the range of siege combat are required to wear eye protection which is sufficient to protect against the missiles in use, such as industrial or sports safety glasses or goggles. Note that SCA legal helms are considered sufficient protection.
