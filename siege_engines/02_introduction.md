# Introduction

This document is designed to provide a basic structure for the safe and effective
 administration of siege engine activities within the SCA. These regulations are designed to
 provide a common structure for siege activities while giving the individual Kingdoms as
 much freedom as possible to develop their own structure for the support of these activities.
 After consultation with several Kingdom marshals, war marshals, fighters, and siege
 engineers, it was determined that there was a need for clarification of the regulations
 involving siege weapons. Most prevalent among the concerns were the difficulty observed in
 calling shots from missile weapons and the confusion resulting from too many types of
 ammunition being used by engines and small arms simultaneously. This document limits the
 types and specifies the appearance of siege ammunition to help address these concerns.
 Also quite common in the discussions were concerns about the legitimacy of giving extra
 powers to siege engines. The ability to kill through shields, for example, is documentable in
 period to almost any class of siege engine, but no other weapon on our field has that power.
 Rather than limit the siege engineer to nothing more than the damage of an arrow, a
 compromise was presented for evaluation and accepted for this rules revision. The
 compromise included a more concise definition of siege weapons, a clearer definition of
 which devices could expect to have what extra damage effect, and a clarification of the
 appearance and functionality of the weapons on the fieldâ€”most notably the restriction of
 rapid-fire devices and devices that would never have existed in period. It is expected that this
 compromise will show positive results, but that some elements will need to be modified
 during the evaluation.
