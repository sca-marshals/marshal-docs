## Engine and Structure Inspection
1. Siege engines shall be inspected before combat use. Engine inspection procedures shall include at least the following:
    1. Any event allowing siege engines must have an equipment inspection station.  This inspection station shall, at minimum, consist of a field with a firing line and range markers at 40 and 80 yards from the firing position.
    2. Preliminary inspection of the engine shall be made before any shots are fired.  The marshal will check for structural integrity of the components of the engine.
    3. The operational demonstration phase of the inspection shall, at minimum, consist of 4 shots from the engine configured for the maximum power it will use on the field at that event. These 4 shots shall deliver the ammunition between 40 and 80 yards at a firing angle of between 40 to 45 degrees elevation without mechanical failure and shall consistently deliver the ammunition downrange.
    4. Static inspection for stability of the engine and mechanical observation of the framework and the mechanism shall be made after the firing.
2. Siege structures shall be inspected before being allowed to participate in an event.  Inspection should include, at minimum, structural integrity, stability, condition of hardware, and condition of any safety devices (barriers, walls, etc.). Ideally, a maximum load of armored combatants should be on board the siege structure during inspection. Inspection will include a demonstration of mobility if the structure is designed to be mobile.
