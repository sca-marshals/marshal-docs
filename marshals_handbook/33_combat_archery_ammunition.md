### Combat Archery Ammunition
1.  All ammunition must have the owner's name and kingdom displayed clearly on it.
2.  No ammunition may be more than 10% covered in the color yellow.
3.  No metal can be used as ammunition construction material.
4.  All ammunition has a maximum length of 28 inches (71 cm) from the back of the blunt, to the string acceptor on the nock.
5.  Optionally, ammunition may have fletches as long as they are securely attached and made of a soft material. Fletches may not project farther than .5 inch (12.7 mm) from the shaft if they are less than 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) thick.
6.  Light Ammunition (for use in light bows or light crossbows) 
    1.  Shafts of light ammunition must be solid pultruded fiberglass of between .25 (6.5 mm) and .375 inch (9.5 mm) diameter.
    2.  Fiberglass shall be of a good quality, defined as significant ‘bending' pressure as applied by a marshal not causing the shaft to break.
    3.  The shaft must be covered from behind the blunt, to the front of the anti-penetration device (APD), in a sturdy tear-resistant tape, such as strapping, electrical, or duct tape.
    4.  Anti-Penetration Devices (APDs) 
        1. APDs must be attached no further than .5 inch (12.7 mm) from the end of the arrow or bolt (including nock).
        2. APDs must be attached securely via tape, glue, cable ties, etc. The method does not matter as long as it is securely attached and will not come off during normal use. This will be tested by Marshals will test this by grabbing and pulling on the APD with moderate force while twisting it slightly. If it detaches or moves lengthwise along the shaft, then it is unsafe.
        3. The following are the ONLY approved styles of APDs:
            1. Siloflex equivalent
                1. APDs must be of Siloflex equivalent material with a pressure rating between 75 and 200psi. The outer diameter must be at least 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) or the inner diameter must be at least 1 inch (25.4 mm).
                2. There may be no cuts in the back end of the APD.
                3. The length of the top edge of the APD must be at least 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) if the front is cut square, or .625 (that is, 5/8) inch (16 mm) if the front is cut at a 45 degree angle.
                4. APD may have a channel routed in the bottom, and/or cuts made in the front edge for helping tape attachment.
                5. All sharp edges must be eased.
            2. Asgard
                1.  Asgard APDs have only the following modifications allowed: Cutting the nock off flush for use on a crossbow, making small holes for helping attachment, and roughing surfaces for gluing.
    5.  Blunts
        1.  All blunts must be securely attached via tape, glue, cable ties, etc. The method does not matter as long as it is securely attached; however at least one piece of strapping, electrical or duct tape must extend over the blunt and be securely attached to the shaft on both sides. This will be tested by marshals by grabbing and pulling on the blunt with moderate force while twisting it slightly.
            If the blunt shows signs of moving off of the shaft, then it fails. (Twisting around the shaft is okay.)
        2. Baldar Blunts
            1.  Baldar Blunts must be of a type designed for use on fiberglass shafts (.25 inch shaft acceptor), and can only be used with .25 inch or 6.5 mm shafts.
            2.  Only the original 2-piece mold Baldar Blunt is allowed. Blunts must be attached in such a way that the blunt can be inspected for the parting line visible around the circumference of the thickest part of the blunt in the 2-piece molds. If no parting line is seen the blunt cannot be used.
        3. UHMW (Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene) 
            1.  UHMW blunts are constructed of at least 1.25 inches (31.8 cm) diameter UHMW rod with a hole drilled in it to accept the shaft.
            2.  The shaft hole must be at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) deep, and there must be at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) of UHMW in front of the shaft.
            3.  At least .5 inch (12.7 mm) and at most 1.25 inch (31.8 cm) of resilient padding after taping must be added in front of the blunt and be at least the same diameter as the blunt.
            4.  The head must have a side-wrap of foam that extends from the tip of the padding to at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) over the UHMW that brings the total diameter of the head to at least 1.5 inch (3.81 mm) after taping.
            5.  The front edges of the blunt must be rounded over.
            6.  As long as all other requirements are met, the blunt may have material removed for aerodynamic or weight reducing purposes.

7.  Heavy Ammunition (for use in heavy bows, heavy crossbows, light bows, or light crossbows)

    Heavy ammunition must be of one of three styles: tubular, tennis ball, or Fellwalker.
    1. Tubular Ammunition
        1.  The shaft must be constructed of Siloflex Equivalent with a pressure rating of 100PSI, 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) exterior diameter or 1 inch (25.4 mm) interior diameter.
        2. The tail must be left solid for at least 1 inch (25.4 mm). Cuts may be made beyond that in order to install fletches if desired but must have holes drilled at the ends of each cut to keep the cut from spreading. The tail may be slit if a 1 inch (25.4 mm) or longer section of Siloflex is reinserted at the end and laced in place. A nock may be cut into the tail end, but may be no deeper than .5 inch (12.7 mm). Wooden nocks can be installed as long as they are securely attached by drilling and lacing with string.
        3.    The head must be constructed in one of the following manners.

        Regardless of the construction method, the head must be firmly attached by the use of tape and/ or string. Marshals will check head attachment by pulling on them with a moderate level of force and twisting slightly. If the head shows signs of loosening, it fails inspection.
            
            1.  Rubber Stopper – A rubber stopper, size 6.5, is placed in the end of the tube such that it enters the tube at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) and is well attached. Resilient padding of at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) and at most 1.25 inch (31.8 mm), after taping, is then added on top of it. The head must also have a side-wrap of foam that extends from the tip of the padding to at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) over the rubber stopper to bring the total diameter of the head to at least 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) after taping.
            2.  Baldar Blunts – Baldar blunts may be used by cutting the support fins away so that the blunt slides over the Siloflex and attaches securely. At least .5 inch (12.7 mm) and at most 1.25 inch (31.8 mm) of resilient padding after taping must be added to the tip. The diameter of the foam after taping must be at least 1.5 inch (3.8 cm). Any classic style of Baldar Blunt can be used in this manner, whether 1 or 2 piece mold or designed for fiberglass or wood.
            3.  Tennis Ball – A tennis ball is placed at the end of the tube and attached via tape and/or string. The ball shall not be perforated as this leads to it getting dirt/water inside of it.

    2.  Tennis Balls
        1.  Regulation tennis balls may be used as ammunition, as is, with the following restrictions.
            1.  Ball must weigh less than 3 ounces (85 grams).
            2.  Ball must not be covered in tape and cannot be yellow. (Dyes or stains may be used to change the color)
    3.  Fellwalker Bolts
        1. The “Fellwalker design” is approved for crossbows only
        2. The shaft is of solid fiberglass of between .25 inch (6.5 mm) and .375 (that is, 3/8) inch (9.5 mm) diameter.
        3. The blunt is made from UHMW rod of at least 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) diameter with a hole drilled in it to accept the shaft.
        4. The shaft hole must be at least 1 inch (25.4 mm) deep, and there must be at least 1 inch (25.4 mm) of UHMW in front of the shaft.
        5. The striking surface must have at least 1 inch (25.4 mm) and at most 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) of resilient foam after taping and be at least the diameter of the blunt.
        6. The head must have a side-wrap of foam that extends from the tip of the padding to at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) over the UHMW that brings the total diameter of the head to at least 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) after taping.
        7. The tail end must have a disk of UHMW installed that is at least 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) diameter, at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) thick, and drilled at least .25 inch (6.5 mm) deep to accept the shaft. The leading edge of the blunt and all edges of the APD shall be rounded over.
