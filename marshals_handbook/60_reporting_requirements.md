### Reporting Requirements
1.  If you are a Marshal-at-Large:
    1.  Whatever processes your Kingdom requires of a warranted marshal.
    2.  Reporting on any incident observed, either during or related to combat, on which the Marshal in Charge was required to report.
2.  If you are the Marshal in Charge of an event:
    1.  Whatever processes your Kingdom requires of a warranted marshal.
    2.  A brief report on the event, including any incidents in which:
        1.  Someone was injured.
        2. A fighter or marshal had to be disciplined.
    3.  Event reports shall go to the Principality Knight Marshal or the Kingdom Earl Marshal. (Reports should not go to the Marshal of the Society!)
    4.  Any other reports that the Earl Marshal of your Kingdom requires. (If you do not know, write and ask what he or she will want before the event. It is a lot easier that way.)
3.  If you are the Knight Marshal of a branch:
    1.  Whatever processes your kingdom requires of a warranted marshal.
    2.  Regular reports on the state of fighting in your branch. If there are subsidiary branches (e.g., cantons or ridings), this includes summarizing the reports that you get from them. Ask your immediate superior how often you need to do this.
    3.  Any other reports that the Earl Marshal of your kingdom requires.
4.  If you are the Principality or Deputy Kingdom Earl Marshal or Knights Marshal:
    1.  Whatever processes your kingdom requires of a warranted marshal.
    2.  Regular reports on the state of fighting in your principality or region.
    3.  Any other reports that the Earl Marshal of your kingdom requires.
5.  If you are the Earl Marshal of a kingdom:
    1.  An agreement to serve as Earl Marshal.
    2.  Quarterly reporting to the Society Marshal regarding the state of fighting in your kingdom. (If you are required to make a similar report to the Crown, a copy to the Society Marshal is sufficient.)
    3.  If disciplinary action that extends beyond the bounds of a single event is being taken against a fighter in your kingdom (e.g., authorizations suspended or revoked, Courts of Chivalry), a brief account of what was done, to whom, and why. (If more information is needed, for example because of an appeal of the action, the Society Marshal will let you know.)
    4.  Either individual warrants must be provided for each member of the marshallate in your kingdom, or a roster must be maintained. (Information on the roster system may be obtained from your kingdom seneschal.) This task may be partially delegated to the regional or principality marshal of your kingdom, if any.
    5.  Answer correspondence from the Knights Marshals of your kingdom.
6.  If you are Marshal of the Society:
    1.  On a quarterly basis, report to the President (and thence to the Board) on the state of the marshallate.
    2.  Provide warrants for the Earls Marshal as they are appointed.
    3.  Answer correspondence from the Earls Marshal.
