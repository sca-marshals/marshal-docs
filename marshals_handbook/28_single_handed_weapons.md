### Single-Handed Weapons
Weapons that shall be used in one hand shall have the following requirements:

1.  Single-handed weapons shall be constructed of one of the following:
    1.  rattan
    2.  rattan-cored Siloflex or Siloflex-equivalent
    3.  natural polypropylene round rod (maximum diameter: 1.25 inches (31.8 mm)

    and shall be not less than 1.25 inch (31.8 mm) in total diameter (including tape) along its entire length excepting the handle.

2.  Rattan-cored Siloflex or Siloflex equivalent weapons shall be constructed using tubular materials meeting ASTM standard D-2239 or the international equivalent, with a pressure rating of 160 PSI or greater, having at least a 1.25 inch (31.8 mm) diameter on the outside and at least .125 (that is, 1/8) inch (3.2 mm) walls, and having an inner core of rattan that fills the interior of the tubular material entirely. Periodic inspection shall be made to determine the condition of the inner core.
3.  If the weapon has a head, it shall not be constructed of solely rigid materials. The head shall be firmly and securely attached to the haft. The head shall allow at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) of progressive give between the striking surface and the weapon haft.
4.  No weapon may have a cutting and/or smashing surface at both ends.
5.  When thrusting tips are used, they shall be at least the same diameter as the shaft of the weapon they are mounted on and have at least .75 inch (19.1 mm) of resilient material in front of the rigid tip of the weapon providing at least .375 (that is, 3/8) inch (9.53 mm) of progressively resistant give across the face of the thrusting tip. (Note: Pressing with the thumb into the center of the thrusting tip is not an adequate test. The give must be across the entire face of the tip.)
6.  Swords shall have a hand guard, such as a basket hilt, quillions, or equivalent.
7.  Total weapon mass shall not exceed 5 pounds (2.27 kg).
