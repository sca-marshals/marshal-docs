### Sample Armor Inspection
See Section VI, “Armor Requirements” above for Society minimum standards.

1.  Leg Armor: Check that the front and sides of the knee are covered. Have the fighter flex their knees (either a deep knee bend or one knee at a time) and see that the knee remains covered and that the articulation (if any) does not gap. Check for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that the equipment is falling apart.
2.  Groin: ASK the fighter if they have remembered their cup or groin protection. Do NOT attempt to check for it physically.
3.  Kidneys: Check for kidney armor. (Kidneys are located in the back, at the bottom of the ribs, but the armor should also extend around to the sides.)
4.  Elbows: Check that the point and sides of each elbow are covered. Have the fighter flex their elbows and see that the elbow remains covered and that the articulation (if any) does not gap. Check for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that the equipment is faulty.
5.  Hands and Wrists: Check the gauntlet and/or basket hilt. Look to see whether the gauntlet will pinch the hand if it is hit. Check for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that the equipment is faulty.
6.  Neck and Head:
    1.  Check that the neck, larynx, and cervical vertebrae are covered.
    2.  Check the face plate and eye slots, both for the size of openings (a 1 (one)-inch dowel is a quick way to check and hard to argue with) and to be sure that it is firmly secured.
    3.  Put your hand on the front of the helm, and have the fighter push against it. See that their face does not hit the faceplate. (A gentle touch of the tip of the nose at maximum pressure may not be desirable, but is not necessarily grounds for rejecting the helm.) Repeat with the sides and back of the helm.
    4.  Have the fighter turn their head toward their shield side. See that the neck is still not exposed.
e.  Have the fighter tilt their chin up as far as possible and check the neck again (this is intended to simulate the position they might be in if they had just taken a blow high up on the front of the helm). If you can reach in (with your fist, or the dowel that you used to check the face openings) and touch bare throat, the problem should be repaired before the fighting starts.
    5.  Have the fighter move their chin down as far as possible and repeat for the back of the neck.
    6.  Lift gently on the front of the faceplate to make sure that the helm does not rotate easily to expose the face or throat.
    7.  After making sure that the fighter does not have their tongue between their teeth, test the chinstrap (or equivalent) by lifting up sharply on both sides of the helm. It should not rise up so far as to expose the head or neck.
    8.  Check for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that the equipment is faulty.
7.  Shield: Check the rim for exposed sharp edges. (For this purpose, a 90-degree angle is a sharp edge.) Check the rest of the shield for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that it is faulty.
