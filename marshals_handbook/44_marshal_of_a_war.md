### Marshal of a War
1.  A supervising marshal (marshal in charge) shall be chosen for each war (and possibly for each battle, if the MIC for the war is fighting in the battles or otherwise prevented from being present).
    1.  The marshal-in-charge shall be responsible for the activities of the marshals in his charge.
    2.  If possible, the marshal-in-charge should not be a member of one of the groups on the field.
    3.  The marshal-in-charge for a particular battle may not participate in the battle as a combatant.
2.  When “Hold!” is called, all fighting shall cease. 
    1.  Fighters shall drop to one knee (if possible) where they stand.
    2.  Conversations relating to the conduct of the battle are not permitted between combatants.
    3.  Changes of position/location are not permitted, unless ordered by a marshal.
    4.  If movement away from a boundary of a hazard is necessary, the fighters shall maintain their relative positions and distances.
    5.  To end a hold, the marshal-in-charge will call “All rise!” (or “Rise if you're able” or some other equivalent statement). When the combatants have resumed their guard, the marshal-in-charge will call “Lay on!” to signal the resumption of the fight.
3.  “Hold!” will normally be called only for broken armor, lost tempers, injuries, safety concerns, outsiders wandering onto the field, fighters about to wander off it, or to enforce the rules and scenario limits.
4.  “Hold!” should not be called for dropped weapons, fighters who have slipped and fallen (unless they are in danger of injury), or the near approach of a fighter to a boundary where there are neither spectators nor any natural hazards, such as cliffs.
5.  Marshals have the preemptory authority to remove from combat and from the field any combatant who violates the rules or scenario limits or who performs any unsafe or dishonorable act. Such removal may be discussed during the battle only if the marshal permits it. The marshals' ruling may be appealed to the Marshal in Charge.
6.  Marshals have the authority to regulate the movement of non-combatants on and near the field and to control the location of spectators.
7.  Those marshals who are responsible for marshaling wars or large melees may use alternative means to signal “Hold” or “Lay on,” as long as all fighters and marshals know and understand the alternative signaling system. Marshals may use whistles, air horns, or other such devices.
