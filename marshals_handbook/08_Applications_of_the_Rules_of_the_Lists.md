### Applications of the Rules of the Lists
1.  Application of Rule 1: “Other participants” include marshals and support personnel whose activities bring them close to fighting in a situation where boundaries are not clearly defined. Heralds, list pages, and similar officers who leave the field entirely before combat begins are exempt from this requirement, as are water-bearers and chirurgeons who remain in fixed support points outside the tournament field or battle area. Water-bearers and chirurgeons who take part in mobile support groups within the overall boundaries of a battle area must receive a basic orientation in field safety.
2.  Application of Rule 2: The Crown and/or marshallate of each kingdom shall establish standards and procedures for the authorization of fighters to participate in combat. These procedures shall adhere to the combat authorization procedures in this handbook. At kingdom option, these procedures may involve either a general authorization to participate in armored combat or a set of separate authorization procedures for the use of (or for combat AGAINST) specific weapons or classes of weapons.
The Crown and/or marshallate of each kingdom shall establish standards and procedures for the authorization of combat archers and missile users to participate in combat. Kingdoms may establish such additional limitations on the participation of minors as may be deemed necessary. It is usual for authorizations from other kingdoms to be accepted, although exceptions may prove necessary in the case of specific individuals.
The Crown may not simply grant an authorization, unless the recipient has successfully completed the authorization process as delineated in Society and kingdom law.
3.  Application of Rule 4: Kingdoms may apply armor and weapons standards that are stricter than the Society standards, should they be deemed necessary, but may not reduce or waive any Society standard.
4.  Application of Rule 5: If a fighter regards an opponent's weapon or armor as unduly dangerous to self or opponent, he or she can request that the marshal on the field re-inspect the item. Either fighter has the option of appealing the decision of the re-inspection marshal to the marshal in charge and ultimately to the sovereign.
5.  Application of Rule 6: Engaging in any Society combat activity with the deliberate intent to inflict bodily harm to an opponent is strictly forbidden.
6.  Application of Rule 7: No one is required to engage in SCA combat should he or she prefer not to do so.
7.  Application of Rule 8: Since fighting with real weapons is forbidden at any Society event, threatening the use of such weapons is likewise expressly forbidden.

    At the discretion of the sovereign and the MIC, recognized experts may be permitted to present choreographed demonstrations with real weapons under strictly controlled conditions.

    No one may wear any real weapon onto the field while participating in combat or present during combat. At the discretion of the sovereign and the MIC, an exception may be made for marshals or other noncombatants to wear knives bonded with peace straps.
Posing for still photographs with real weapons is permitted.

8.  Application of Rule 9: The prohibition on thrown weapons refers to weapons thrown in combat or thrown in a hostile manner. It does not apply to “tossing,” defined as a gentle, short-range method of transferring or removing a tournament weapon or item from the list field or area of combat. The use of bows and arrows, firearms, slings, javelins, throwing axes, throwing knives, or any other projectile weapon is forbidden within tournament lists, or in any other situation where spectators cannot be separated from the potential line of fire by more than the effective range of the weapon.
