### Experimental Weapons and Materials 
1.  Before any unapproved weapon or material can be used at Society activities, a test plan and a sample of the proposed weapon or material must be submitted to and approved by the Society Marshal or a designated deputy. This plan shall include:
    1.  Specifics on construction (e.g., materials used, how it is assembled, etc.),
    2.  A detailed outline of the test and its scope.
    3.  All restrictions that will be imposed on the test.
    4.  How long the test period would be.

    If requested, any samples submitted shall be returned to the submitting party no later than the conclusion of the test period, unless otherwise specified.
2.  It is the prerogative of the kingdom Earl Marshal to allow limited testing of alternate or unapproved materials and weapons within a kingdom after receiving approval from the Society Marshal. Limited testing means the weapon or material may be used at fighter practice tourneys and in small melees, but only after all combatants and marshals have been informed the weapon or material is being tested and that it is not approved for general SCA use.
3.  All combatants and marshals must consent to the use of the weapon or material before combat begins. If any of the marshals or combatants object to the use of the material or weapon, the material or weapon may not be used in that fight or battle. All experimental materials and weapons shall be marked with alternating bands of red and green tape totaling 6 inches (15.2 cm) in length. Bands shall be visible during weapon usage.
4.  Once per quarter throughout the test period, the Earl Marshal will update the Society Marshal on the progress and results of the testing. At the end of the test period, the Earl Marshal will provide the Society Marshal with a test summary. This summary shall include a list of injuries that resulted from the use of the weapon or material and any concerns from fighters and marshals recorded during the testing. The Society Marshal, after consultation with the Earls Marshal, shall determine if the weapon or material is suitable for SCA combat-related activities.
