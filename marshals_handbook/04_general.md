### General
1. All persons who wish to participate in SCA combat activities must authorize under the Society and Kingdom-of-residence authorization procedures. SCA combat activities are defined as armored combat, Society period fencing, combat archery siege, and marshaling. Other martial activities clearly falling within the scope above are also considered combat-related activities. Youth combat programs are not supervised at the Society level, but participation in such programs requires authorization following Kingdom-of-residence procedures.
2. Each Kingdom shall establish a procedure to authorize combatants for participation in SCA combat-related activities. These procedures shall verify that the candidate is familiar with the following:
    1.  Rules of the Lists of the SCA.
    2.  The Armor and Weapons standards of the SCA.
    3.  The Conventions of Combat for the SCA.
    4.  Kingdom-of-residence–specific Conventions of Combat.
    4.  Kingdom-of-residence–specific Armor and Weapons Standards.
3.  In addition to the above requirements, candidates must demonstrate the ability to function on the field in a manner that is safe both to themselves and to their opponents.
4.  Only a warranted or rostered authorized marshal may perform an authorization. This authorizing marshal must witness the authorization and execute the appropriate paperwork to ensure that the authorization is registered with the appropriate kingdom official.
5.  Authorization shall be registered with, and kept on file by, the Minister of the Lists or another designated official of each kingdom. This office shall be responsible for keeping properly completed waivers and maintaining the registration of authorizations. This office shall provide the Earl Marshal with a list of all current combat authorization cards upon request. 
6.  No authorization card may be issued until a properly completed Waiver is filed with the Kingdom.
7.  Signed waivers for SCA combat-related activities shall be kept on file for a period of seven (7) years.
8.  Combat authorizations may be issued for a period of time equal to the time that the combat participant has an active waiver on file.
9.  Authorizations shall not be issued to persons residing in a kingdom other than the one in which the authorization is being issued, unless a specific royal treaty defines the person seeking authorization as a subject of the issuing kingdom.
10. Kingdoms may define additional types of authorization, such as weapon forms, field marshals, and missile combat marshals, and requirements for them, as may be deemed necessary.
11. Valid combat authorization cards shall be accepted outside the issuing kingdom as proof of authorization, as long as proof of a signed and active waiver is available. Kingdoms may define additional requirements before renewing an authorization card for a person who has moved into that kingdom from another kingdom.
12. A marshal from any kingdom may revoke the authorization card of a fighter from any other kingdom for just and stated cause. The marshal in charge (MIC) of the event should be notified immediately and the Earl Marshal of the fighter's kingdom of residence should receive a detailed report of the incident.
