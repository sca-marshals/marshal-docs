### Behavior on the Field
1.  Striking an opponent with excessive force is forbidden.
2.  All fighters shall obey the commands of the marshals on the field or shall be removed from the field and subject to disciplinary action. Disagreements with the marshals on the field shall be resolved through the established mechanisms outlined in the Procedures for Grievances and Sanctions of the Marshallate Procedures of the SCA, Inc.
3.  Each fighter shall maintain control over his or her temper at all times.
4.  Upon hearing the call of “HOLD” all fighting shall IMMEDIATELY stop. 
5.  A fighter shall not enter the lists or participate in any form of SCA combat activity while impaired by alcohol or drugs (including, but not limited to: drugs prescribed by a licensed health care provider, over- the-counter medications, and illegal controlled substances.)
6.  Any behavior that takes deliberate advantage of an opponent's chivalry or safety-consciousness, or that takes deliberate unfair advantage of an opponent, is prohibited.
7.  A fighter shall not deliberately strike a helpless opponent.
8.  Any fighter who obtains an unfair advantage by repeatedly becoming “helpless” (for example, by falling down or losing their weapon) may, after being duly warned by the marshals on the field, be forced to yield the fight at the next occurrence of such behavior. The onus of this is on the marshals, not on the opponent. However, the opponent may ask the marshals to let the fight continue.
9.  Grappling, tripping, throwing, punching, kicking, and wrestling are prohibited. Contact between combatants' bodies, shields, and weapons is expected in corps-a-corps or mêlée situations, as such controlled contact is allowed during these engagements.

11. Grasping an opponent's person, shield, weapon's striking surface, or bow/crossbow is prohibited. 
12. Intentionally striking an opponent outside the legal target areas is forbidden.
