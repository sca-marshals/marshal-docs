### Combat Archery Conventions
1.  Upon a hold being called, all archers must unload their weapons (crossbows may remain cocked).
2.  Archers may have a backup weapon on them, but may not draw it until their bow has been safely disposed of (taken off the field, discarded in a low traffic area, handed to another combatant, etc). Upon drawing a backup weapon to enter combat, hands must be appropriately armored.
3.  Archers may carry and use thrown weapons without need to discard their bow or change hand armor.
4.  Archers need to be aware of what is beyond their target area to ensure that errant shots do not endanger anyone.
5.  An archer's minimum range is dictated by ensuring that the ammunition completely clears the bow before contacting the opponent.
6.  Ammunition dropped onto the ground is considered dead as if it had been fired, and needs re-inspection.
7.  Live combatants may pick ammunition off the field for re-inspection (as long as re-inspection is allowed during the scenario) and reuse it during the same battle. Dead combatants may clear ammunition from the field for use in future battles if scenario rules allow.
8.  Within scenario limits, ammunition may be taken from caches stored on or off the field and from other combatants (dead or alive) with permission of the owner.
