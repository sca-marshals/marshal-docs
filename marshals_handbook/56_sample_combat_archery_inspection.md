### Sample Combat Archery Inspection
1.  Bow/Crossbow 
    1.  Ensure that the string is not showing excessive wear.
    2.  Measure the power of the bow with a calibrated scale to ensure it is within appropriate specs.
    3.  Check the bow itself for cracks or gouges, as well as for significant limb twist that could make the string leave the tips.
2.  Crossbow Only
    1.  Check that the lock mechanism releases smoothly under simulated pressure.
    2.  Check that the lock mechanism is solid and will not accidentally fire.
    3.  Ensure the stock has no failures between the bow and lock.
3.  Ammunition
    1.  Based upon the type of ammunition, measure all dimensions for conformance
    2.  Grab both head and tail and pull with moderate force while slightly twisting. If either end moves laterally it fails.
    3.  If the ammunition is with made with foam, check that the tip is constructed in such a manner that it cannot be forced more than .5 inch (12.7 mm) into a legal faceguard.
    4.  Check the shaft for signs of cracking or other failure. Check that it is properly labeled and taped.
    5.  Remember that ammunition cannot be more than 10% yellow as yellow is reserved for siege ammunition.
