### Sanctions
1.  In addition to removing an unsafe combatant from the field at the time, long-term sanctions are available. These will normally be applied by the marshallate of the kingdom rather than by a local marshal. Procedures outlined in kingdom law or kingdom marshal policies shall be adhered to when sanctioning any person.
2.  Possible sanctions include:
    1.  Revoking the authorization of the individual to fight with a particular weapon. (This sanction may be applied whether or not your kingdom does authorizations by weapon forms.)
    2.  Revoking the authorization of the individual to fight at all.
    3.  Recommendation to the Crown to banish the individual from participation in events.
    4.  Recommendation to the Board to banish the individual from the Society and its activities.
3.  If any of these long-term sanctions are in progress, the Society Marshal shall be informed.
4.  If authorization has been revoked, it is acceptable to inform the Earls Marshal of any neighboring kingdoms to which the currently unauthorized fighter might travel. Once long-term sanctions have been applied, a report shall be made to the Marshal of the Society.
5.  An authorization from any Kingdom may be suspended/revoked in another Kingdom, should it prove necessary and appropriate. Such suspension/revocation means that the fighter may not fight anywhere in the Society until and unless the issue is resolved. Accordingly, the Earl Marshal of the kingdom issuing the suspension shall inform the Society Earl Marshal and the Earls Marshal of the neighboring kingdoms.
6.  Furthermore, if the fighter is subsequently re-authorized, the neighboring Earls Marshal shall again be notified.
