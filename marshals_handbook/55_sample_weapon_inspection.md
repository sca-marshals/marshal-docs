### Sample Weapon Inspection
See Section VII, “Weapons Standards” above for Society minimum standards.

1.  Swords:
    1.  Check that they meet the minimum diameter (1.25 inch [31.8mm]). A 1.25 inch (31.8mm) marshaling gauge will speed this up enormously.
    2.  Check that the ends are taped and that there are no exposed cuts in the rattan.
    3.  Check the quillions or basket hilts for sharp edges, broken or missing rivets, or other signs that they are coming apart.
    4.  Check the wrist strap or other means of keeping the sword from flying away.
2.  Thrusting Tips: Check that they have the minimum cross section. Push on the end to verify the required amount of resilient give. Check that it the tip is constructed in such a manner that it cannot be forced more than .5 inch (12.7 mm) into a legal faceguard.
3.  Mass Weapons: Check the padding for give. Check the wrist strap (single-handed mass weapons only). Consider the total mass of the weapon.
4.  Pole Weapons: Check the thrusting tip, if any. Check the padding for give. Consider the total mass of the weapon. Check that the weapon meets the relevant length restrictions.
