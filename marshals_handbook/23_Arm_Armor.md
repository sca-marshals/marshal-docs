### Arm Armor
The elbow point and bones at either side of the elbow joint must be covered by a rigid material underlain by at least .25 inch (6 mm) of closed-cell foam or equivalent padding. This armor shall be attached in such a way that the elbow remains covered during combat. A shield alone is sufficient on a side-strapped shield, if the elbow is 4 inches (10.2 cm) or more from the edge of the shield during typical use.
