## MARSHALING REQUIREMENTS
1.  When combat archery is present on the field all marshals, heralds, etc. on the field must wear protective shatterproof eyewear, such as safety glasses meeting the ANSI Z 87.1 standard or better.
2.  A buffer zone needs to be provided between the edges of the battlefield and spectators at all times. This needs to be increased when combat archery is included. The marshal-in-charge must ensure that it is a safe distance (it should not be possible to hit a spectator, either with direct fire or with a bounced arrow), taking into account the type of scenario, to minimize the chances of deflected shots traveling into the spectators. Physical barriers may eliminate the need for a buffer zone or lessen the distance needed.
