### Destroying Siege Engines
1.  Fighters shall stay clear of moving parts and, when possible, approach siege engines/structures from the side.
2.  Striking or thrusting siege engines/structures with hand-held weapons is strictly prohibited.
3.  Siege engines may be destroyed by placing a hand-held weapon on the engine/structure and declaring “this weapon is destroyed,” or by being struck by siege-class munitions from another siege engine.
4.  Siege engine crews are fully armored combatants and should be treated as would be any other fighter on the field.
5.  If fighting occurs within 5 feet (1.524 m) of an engine that is cocked or loaded, a hold shall be called and the engine shall be declared destroyed and removed from the combat area and made safe.
