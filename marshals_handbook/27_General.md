### General
1.  With the exception of the hilts, guards and pommels, no metal or non-approved rigid, granular, or liquid material may be used in the construction of single or two-handed weapons including spears.
2.  Primary weapons used single-handed shall have a wrist strap (or equivalent restraint) which will keep the weapon from leaving the immediate area of the user if released during any part of a bout or combat. Restraints are not required on hafted weapons used single-handed, or on single-handed back-up weapons.
3.  Flails are expressly prohibited. 
4.  Mechanical devices known as “sliders,” which are used to guide or propel spears, are prohibited. 
5.  All weapons shall have all cutting edges and thrusting tips marked in a contrasting color.
6.  The striking surfaces of all weapons, including the tip, shall be wrapped in a manner that allows no rattan splinters to protrude.
7.  All thrusting tips and striking heads must be securely attached to the weapon.
8.  The edges and tips of all striking surfaces shall be rounded.
9.  No part of a weapon shall have sharp edges or protrusions with cross-section of less than 1.25 inch (31.8mm) in diameter. Guards, pommels, hooks, etc., shall be firmly and securely affixed to the weapon haft.
10. It shall not be possible to force into a legal face guard, any part of a weapon which may reasonably be expected to contact an opponent during combat more than .5 inch (12.7 mm). Rattan weapons may have a handle section which is less than 1.25 inch (31.8 mm), so long as it meets this criterion. Combat archery shafts may be thinner as long as the head and tail meet the criteria.
11. Rattan shall not be treated in any way that will substantially reduce its flexibility (e.g., treated with wax, resin, fiberglass, etc.).
12. No weapon shall exceed 6 pounds (2.73 kg).
13. No missile weapons intended to simulate firearms, slings, slingstaffs, nor atlatls can be used on the field of armored combat. 
14. No “punch weapons” or thrusting weapons that have the blade or tip more perpendicular than parallel to the grip.
15. No shovel handles on any thrusting weapon.
16. Weapons under 48” (1.22 m) or greater than 7' 6” (2.29 m) in length may have either a thrusting tip or a butt spike, but not both at the same time. The madu was not a weapon of individual combat during the SCA's period of study, and therefore it is excluded from SCA Armored Combat.
