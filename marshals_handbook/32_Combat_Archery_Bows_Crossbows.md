### Combat Archery Bows/Crossbows 
1.  During inspection, all equipment must have its poundage and draw physically measured with a ruler or other metered device and poundage scale.
2.  Marshals must calibrate their bow scales regularly to be accurate at either 30 or 50 pounds, depending upon the most prevalent bow in their kingdom, as measurements obtained with commonly-used, standard spring-type scales can vary over time.
3.  No compound bows, nor compound crossbow prods are allowed.
4.  No non-Society period sights, spring/flipper rests, plunger buttons, stabilizers, clickers, or modern string release aids may be used.
5.  Bows/Crossbows must be powered solely by the flex of the limbs.
6.  If both Light and Heavy bows/crossbows, by the standards as defined below, are on the field at the same time, then all Heavy bows/crossbows must have their upper limb (or one limb for crossbows) covered with at least 4 inches (10 cm) of red material (tape, cloth, etc).
7.  Handbows
    1.  A handbow's power is measured at 28 inches (71 cm). If the bow cannot be drawn 28 inches (71 cm), then it cannot be used in SCA combat.
    2.  The minimum measurement for all handbows is 20 pounds (9.1 kg) at 28 inches (71 cm).
    3.  Light handbows measure 30 pounds (13.6 kg) or less at 28 inches (71 cm).
    4.  Heavy handbows measure 50 pounds (22.7 kg) or less at 28 inches (71 cm).
8.  Crossbows
    1.  Crossbows are measured by inch-pounds (”#), which is calculated by taking the poundage of the bow measured at the lock, multiplied by the distance (in inches) from the front of the string at rest, to the front of the string when in cocked position. (A metric measurement of kilogram-centimeters (kg-cm) is also allowed.)
    2.  The minimum measurement for all crossbows is 400”# (461 kg-cm).
    3.  Light crossbows measure 600”# (691 kg-cm) or less.
    4.  Heavy crossbows measure 1000”# (1152 kg-cm) or less.
    5.  No crossbows may have a modern pistol grip.
