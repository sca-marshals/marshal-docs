### Shields
1.  Shields shall be edged with leather, padding, or other covering or constructed in such a way as to minimize damage to rattan weapons or other fighters.
2.  No bolts, wires, or other objects may project more than .375 (that is, 3/8) inch (9 mm) from any part of a shield without being padded. Rounded shield bosses are not considered to be projections.
3.  Shields may be constructed with leg(s) so that they can act as freestanding pavises during melee combat.
    1.  The leg(s) used to keep the pavise standing must be at least 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) in diameter or 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) square and be well-attached.
    2.  Pavises are destroyed by a single hit from siege engine ammunition. Combatants behind the pavise are not killed. The pavise must then immediately be removed from the field or dropped flat.
    3.  A pavise can be carried in a manner which does not require hand control (such as by a shoulder strap). In this case, the fighter is not allowed to actively block with it, nor can they use their own weapon, and if struck by a hand weapon, the blow is counted as if the pavise was not there.
