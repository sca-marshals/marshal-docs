### Minor Authorization
Minors (ages 14–17) may authorize with these additional requirements:

1.  In order to be authorized as a combatant or marshal in adult armored combat, an individual must have attained his or her sixteenth (16th) birthday. In order to be authorized as a participant, combatant, or marshal in any other form of Society combat-related activity, except youth combat, an individual must have attained his or her fourteenth (14th) birthday.
2.  No person below the age of eighteen (18) may be warranted as a group Marshal, or the Marshal in Charge of an event.
3.  The parents or guardians of the minor must witness SCA combat, discuss with a witnessing marshal how it relates to the participation of their child, and execute a “Minor's Waiver and Informed Consent to Participate in SCA Combat-Related Activities.” The witnessing Marshal must countersign the waiver. 
4.  Only the Earl Marshal, the Principality Marshal, or a designated deputy may authorize the minor for SCA Combat-Related Activities.
5.  At any event in which the minor is involved in SCA combat-related activities, the minor must either have a parent or guardian present, or must be in possession of a properly executed “Medical Authorization Form for Minors.” Said Medical Authorization Form must designate an adult present at the event as able to authorize medical treatment in the case of an emergency.
6.  Minors engaging in combat with adults shall be marked in the following manner: A single yellow diamond no larger than 1inch (25.4 mm) but no smaller than 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) to be placed on the front hemisphere of the helm (preferably on or near the inspection sticker). Minors competing with adults in Rapier will have the same diamond on the cuff of the glove of their dominant weapon hand.
