### Throwing Weapons
These weapons may be used for striking and may also be thrown in melee scenarios where thrown weapons are allowed. Examples are thrust-and-throw javelins, axes, knives, etc.

1.  Shafts shall be constructed of rattan not less than 1.25 inch (31.8 mm) in diameter along its entire length or of two layers of Siloflex or equivalent. The outer layer shall be 1 inch (25.4 mm) inner diameter Siloflex (1.25 inch [31.8mm] outer diameter) and the inner layer shall be 0.75 inch (19.1 mm) inner diameter Siloflex. All Siloflex used for throwing weapons must have a pressure rating of 160 PSI or greater. If Siloflex is used, both ends of the shaft shall be covered with either a schedule-40 PVC cap with an interior diameter the same as the outside diameter of the shaft (1.25 inches [31.8 mm]), or with a rubber stopper or equivalent means to prevent the tubing from penetrating the thrusting tip(s), fastened securely in place by tape and/or glue.
2.  Thrusting tips shall be used on any tip that can be reasonably assumed to contact a fighter when the weapon is used or thrown. Tips shall be no less than 2 inches (50.8 mm) in diameter/cross-section and have 2 inches (50.8 mm) of resilient material in front of the rigid tip of the weapon, thereby providing progressively resistant give.
3.  If the weapon has a head, it shall not be constructed of solely rigid materials. The head shall be firmly and securely attached to the haft or handle. The head shall allow at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) of progressive give between the striking surface and the weapon haft or handle.
4.  The weapon must have the owner's name, kingdom, and branch clearly and legibly printed on it in English characters for identification.
5.  Total mass of the weapon shall not exceed 2 pounds (0.91 kg).
