### Weapons
*Striking surface*: Because of the nature of our activities and the ability of our weapons to break during use the “striking surface” of a weapon is to be considered throughout the entire striking portion, blade, or head, of the weapon, not only the outside “skin” or layer. This includes all interior construction materials and parts no matter how “deep” inside.

*Approved rigid plastics*: Siloflex and Siloflex equivalents are currently the only rigid plastic approved for the striking surface of a weapon.

*Bow*: A projectile launcher consisting of a material held under tension by a string. Also referred to as a Handbow.

*Crossbow*: A projectile launcher consisting of a bow (called a prod) being mounted to a stock, with a lock mechanism to hold the string and full draw and allow its release via a trigger.

*Flail*: a weapon with a striking surface attached to the handle via a flexible arm or pivot.

*Laminated rattan*: Two pieces of rattan, each being at least 1 inch (25.4 mm) in diameter, attached to one another with a short overlap by tape or other method of binding. Maximum length of the overlap shall be 18 inches (85.7 cm) or half of the length of the added rattan, whichever is shorter. Note that use of glues, epoxies, or adhesives, which substantially reduce the flexibility of the rattan, is prohibited.

*Missile weapon*: any weapon which is intended to deliver a blow without being held in the hand (e.g., arrows, javelins, quarrels, or various soft projectiles from catapults).

*Polearms*: hafted weapons, generally long, designed to be wielded with two hands (e.g., glaives, halberds, etc.). 

*Progressively resistant give (as used in discussions of thrusting tips)*: As pressure is applied directly to the thrusting surface, it will compress gradually, without bottoming-out or bending to the side enough to expose the end of the blade or haft of the weapon to which it is attached.

*Quillions*: cross-guards of a sword.

*Siloflex*: A brand-name polyethylene tubing made from PE3408 resin and conforming to ASTM D2239 standards. The material is approved for various uses throughout the rules in pressure ratings ranging from 75 PSI to 200 PSI. Please check the standards in the appropriate area of the rules for what is allowed.

*Siloflex equivalent*: other tubing or pipe, typically made for drinking water applications, made from polyethylene resins with the ASTM classification of PE 3408 and produced to the ASTM D2239 standard. Spears: hafted weapons designed for thrusting only; also called pikes.

*Single-handed mass weapons*: maces, axes, war hammers, or other weapons designed primarily to crush or punch holes (on account of the weight of the real weapons), rather than primarily to cut (on account of sharp edges on the real weapon). Maximum length for single-handed mass weapons is 48 inches (122cm).

*Slider*: a tube or similar device that wraps around the shaft of a spear and is held in one hand, allowing the spear to slide through it. Use of sliders is prohibited.

*Split rattan*: Rattan of at least 1.25 inch (31.75 mm) diameter which has been split in two and applied to a weapon such that the striking surface of the split piece retains a cross section of 1.25 inch (25.4 mm). Split rattan construction does not place the split rattan directly against the non-split haft of the weapon, but rather spaces the split off of the haft to allow give in the head by flexion of the split of rattan.

*Swords*: single- or double-edged, bladed cutting weapons (including swords with thrusting tips).

*Two-handed cutting or smashing weapons*: includes two-handed swords, greatswords, bastard swords, polearms, and similar weapons.

*UHMW*: Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene – A wear resistant plastic with outstanding impact strength.

C.  Other Definitions
*Armored combat*: A full contact, non-choreographed re-creation of medieval foot combat utilizing clothing, protective armor, and simulated weapons constructed in accordance with SCA standards, with the overall goal of recreating the appearance and methods of combat from the historical period covered by the SCA. For purposes of this definition, all combatants are held to be equipped in the same manner, defined as that of approximately 1100 AD: a knee-length mail hauberk, one-piece helm with nasal, and boiled leather defenses for the lower arms and legs. Weapons and armor are constructed from approved materials as defined by the Society Marshal. Adult armored combat as defined above does not include light contact martial forms, such as rapier and youth combat. Adult armored combat includes all combat archery and siege weaponry used in melees or for war.

*Armored fighter*: a combatant equipped in inspected and approved armor, who meets at least the minimum requirements for combat using rattan weapons, and who uses said rattan weapons in combat.

*Authorization*: a procedure which determines that the individual fighter has, at minimum, read and become familiar with the rules of combat, been observed while fighting, and met any further requirements for authorization to ensure that he or she does not constitute an exceptional safety hazard (either to self or to others). Details of the procedure used vary from kingdom to kingdom and may include further requirements. (Note: The former term “qualification” is still heard, but should be avoided.)

*Battle*: a single combat event in a war or war game wherein a specific scenario is enacted.

*Combat archer*: a combatant equipped in inspected and approved armor, who meets at least the minimum requirements for combat using rattan weapons and who will be using archery equipment in combat. Rules for combat archery weapons and conventions are found in this handbook.

*Directed touch*: a thrust that contacts the face-guard of the helm and, while maintaining contact with the face-guard, continues to travel in the direction of the face.

*Earl Marshal*: the warranted chief marshal of a kingdom.

*Effective blow*: a blow delivered with effective technique for the particular type of weapon used and struck properly oriented and with sufficient force.

*Eric, List Field, Tourney Field*: the defined area for fighting, or the fighting field, usually with a roped-off boundary.

*Fully armored*: For the purposes of acknowledging blows, a fully armored fighter is presumed to be wearing a lightweight, short-sleeved, knee-length, riveted-mail hauberk over a padded gambeson, with boiled leather arm and leg defenses and an open-faced iron helm with a nasal. (The helm may be presumed to include a very light chain mail drape permitting vision and resisting cuts by a mere touch of a bladed weapon.) Also, the hands, wrists, knees and lower legs, and feet, including the areas up to 1 inch (25.4 mm) above the kneecap and 1 inch (25.4 mm) above the bend of the wrist, are not legal targets.

*Helpless opponent*: an opponent who is unable to defend him- or herself from attack for reasons beyond their control. An unarmed opponent is not necessarily helpless.

*Knights Marshal*: The warranted chief marshal of a Principality, Barony, Province, Shire, Canton, etc.

*Missile weapons*: projectile weapons including, but not limited to, bows and arrows, crossbows and bolts, slings and stones or bullets, javelins, darts, and throwing axes.

*Marshal*: someone who is monitoring the conduct of combat on the field. (The marshal in charge of an event shall be a warranted marshal; other individual marshals may or may not be, so long as the marshal in charge finds them competent to do the job.)

*Rattan weapons*: rattan or equivalent weapons including, but not limited to, swords of all lengths, great weapons, mass weapons, pole arms and spears.

*Rostered*: An appointed marshal who is listed on a roster. The roster must include the legal and Society names, address, phone number, and the appointment and expiration dates for each officer. It must be signed by the appropriate royalty and the responsible superior officer, and be updated regularly. The roster must contain a statement that it is the current roster of (office) for the (kingdom, principality) of the Society as of (date). Local Knights Marshal and marshals who are able to perform authorizations must be either warranted or rostered.

*Scenario limits*: The body of rules and definitions which apply to a specific battle, such as the description of real or imaginary terrain features, obstacles, weapons limitations, allowable conduct, and scoring.

*Siege Engineer*: a fully armored participant in armored combat who operates a siege engine.

*Society Marshal, Marshal of the Society, Society Earl Marshal (SEM)*: the warranted chief marshal of the Society for Creative Anachronism.

*War*: a declared state of feigned hostility between two or more kingdoms, branches, or other recognized SCA subdivisions, for the express intent of holding group combat.

*War maneuvers*: group combat events not involving a state of declared hostility, usually with both sides drawn from all of the kingdoms, branches, or other recognized SCA groups participating.

*Warranted*: An appointed marshal who has been appointed by a Warrant of Appointment to Office of the SCA Inc., signed by the appropriate Royalty and the responsible superior officer. Local Knight Marshals, as and marshals who are able to perform authorizations must be either warranted or rostered.

*Youth combat*: Youth combat is a program designed for minors ages 6-17. These programs require armor, require certain weapon construction techniques and materials, train young fighters in proper etiquette, the concepts of Chivalry, Honor and Courtesy, teach teamwork and good sportsmanship, as well as effective fighting arts, in a definitely competitive environment that parallels Adult Armored Combat. It employs Marshals, authorizations and strict controls. The Marshallate is responsible for Youth Combat, and each Kingdom is allowed to develop and run its own program.
