### General Requirements
There are three near-equal priorities in marshaling; safety, fair witness, and showmanship. Overemphasizing any one of these at the expense of the others will tend to make the fighting less enjoyable for everyone (although, if you must go overboard on one, pick safety).

1.  A marshal may be authorized after demonstrating the ability to oversee combat, judge a fighter's authorization, and inspect weapons and armor.
2.  Unless warranted or rostered by the Earl Marshal as an officer of the kingdom, a marshal may not be the marshal-in-charge (MIC) of an event or sign the paperwork to authorize fighters.
3.  Kingdoms may have other types of Marshals other than Authorized Marshals (local Knight Marshals, Constables, etc.) as they see fit. These individuals may be warranted or rostered by the Earl Marshal of the Kingdom. However, unless the marshal has undergone a Marshal's Authorization, they shall not give final approval of the suitability of weapons or armor, or be involved in the authorization of combat participants.
4.  Only the Earl Marshal or designated Deputy Earl Marshal(s) may perform a Marshal's Authorization. They must witness the authorization and execute the appropriate paperwork to ensure that the authorization is registered. At a minimum, a Marshal's Authorization shall include the following:
5.  The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Rules of the Lists, the Society Conventions of Combat, and any additional kingdom rules or conventions.
a.  The candidate must be willing to enforce the Rules of the Lists, the Society Conventions of Combat, and any additional kingdom rules or conventions.
b.  The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Society minimum armor and weapons standards and any additional kingdom armor and weapons standards.
c.  The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of armor and weapons for use in combat.
d.  The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of combatants.
e.  The candidate must demonstrate the ability to safely control SCA combat, whether this is single combat, team combat, general melee, or part of a war environment.
6.  The term “Knight Marshal” applies to the marshal of a branch. This title of office is used regardless of whether the marshal is a belted fighter; in fact it is used whether or not the branch marshal is an authorized fighter.
7.  All warranted or rostered marshals shall be members of the Society for Creative Anachronism Inc.
