### Two-Handed Weapons
Weapons which may be used with one or two hands shall have the following requirements:

1.  Weapons shall be constructed of rattan of not less than 1.25 inch (31.8 mm) in diameter (including tape). Polearms may contain blades constructed of split rattan, so long as the piece(s) are securely fastened to the haft.
2.  The weapon shall not be excessively flexible.
3.  If the weapon has a head, it shall not be constructed of solely rigid materials. The head shall be firmly and securely attached to the haft. The head shall allow at least .5 inch (12.7 mm) of progressive give between the striking surface and the weapon haft. Semi-rigid ultra-lightweight shaped foam heads and laminated or split rattan construction techniques do not require .5 inch (12.7 mm) of progressive give, so long as their construction imparts striking characteristics similar to an unpadded weapon constructed of a single piece of rattan.
4.  No weapon may have a cutting and/or smashing surface at both ends.
5.  Thrusting tips: 
    1.  When thrusting tips are used on rattan weapons with greater length than 7.5 feet (2.286 m), they shall be no less than 2 inches (50.8 mm) in diameter/cross-section and have 2 inches (50.8 mm) of resilient material in front of the rigid tip of the weapon, thereby providing progressively resistant give.
    2.  When thrusting tips are used on rattan weapons with length less than or equal to 7.5 feet, they shall be at least the same diameter as the shaft of the weapon they are mounted on and have 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) of resilient material in front of the rigid tip of the weapon, thereby providing progressively resistant give.

        (Note: Pressing with the thumb into the center of the thrusting tip is not an adequate test. The give must be across the entire face of the tip.)
6.  Weapons exceeding 7.5 feet (2.286 m) shall not be used for cutting or smashing and shall be used for thrusting only.
7.  Total weapon length shall not exceed 12 feet (3.658 m).
