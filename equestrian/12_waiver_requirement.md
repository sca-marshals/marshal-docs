The "Waiver and Informed Consent to Participate in SCA Inc.  Equestrian Activities" shall be signed during authorization with only one signature per form. If a State specific "Waiver" is available it should be used. If there is no "Waiver" for your State, then use the "Society Standard Equine Activity Liability Form". An additional sheet may be attached to contain additional personal information. This requirement does not apply to areas and countries that are covered by affiliate corporations.
