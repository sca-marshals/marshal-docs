#### Helm
1. Helms must be of rigid materials (18-gauge mild steel or equivalent).  Fencing masks are acceptable for mounted crest combat use only.  Equestrian Handbook, Revised October 10, 2012.
2. Face guards shall prevent a 1-inch (25.4mm) diameter dowel from entering into any of the face guard openings.
3. The face guard shall extend at least 1-inch (25.4mm) below the bottom of the chin and jaw line when the head is held erect.
4. All movable visors shall be attached and secured in such a way that there is minimal chance that they will become detached or come open in normal mounted combat or jousting use.
5. There shall be NO major internal projections; minor projections of necessary structural components shall be padded. All metal shall be free of sharp edges.  Face guard bars or mesh should not attach to the interior of the helm, unless of structurally superior design and workmanship.
6. All parts of the helm that might come into injurious contact with the wearer’s head shall be padded with a minimum of ½-inch (12.7mm) of closed-cell foam or equivalent padding, or shall be suspended in such a way as to prevent injurious contact with the wearer during combat. Additional padding is not required for fencing masks used for mounted crest combat only.
7. All helms shall be equipped with a chinstrap or equivalent means to prevent the helm from being dislodged or metal contacting the wearer’s face during combat. An equivalent might be, for example, a bevor or a chin-cup suspension system. A "snug fit" is NOT an equivalent. The chinstrap shall be at a minimum a ½-inch (12.7mm) in width and shall not be placed in the helm in a manner that could strangle the wearer.
