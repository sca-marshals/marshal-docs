# Introduction to the Society Equestrian Handbook
As our equestrian community marks its 40th anniversary, we have chosen to examine how we conduct equestrian activities within our Society.
There have been a number of changes made to the Society Equestrian Handbook that reflect the experiences we have had and the tremendous growth of equestrian activities. 
Please take a moment to note the changes, as they reflect a different approach to how we intend to conduct equestrian activities at our events. 
The most significant changes are intended to streamline the process of authorizing equestrian activities and to address how we conduct individual equestrian authorizations.
It places greater emphasis on individual accountability for equestrians and more opportunity to enjoy equines at events.
With proper management the inherent risks associated with equestrian activities can be minimized in order to allow us to enjoy these magnificent animals.
Please note that the rules relating to certain equestrian activities, i.e.  jousting, mounted combat, etc., that were formerly contained in this handbook have been broken out into a separate set of guidelines in order to allow easier dissemination of information relating to those activities.
