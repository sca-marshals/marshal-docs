#### Crests for mounted crest combat
1. Crests shall be at least 5-inches in height.
2. The crest must be constructed so as not to present an undue hazard if a rider should land on it, or a horse step on it.
3. The crest must be attached in such a way so as to be easily dislodged by a minimal force blow. Velcro or similar methods are recommended.
