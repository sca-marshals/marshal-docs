# Introduction to the Society Equestrian Handbook
As our equestrian community marks its 40th anniversary, we have chosen to examine how we conduct equestrian activities within our Society.
There have been a number of changes made to the Society Equestrian Handbook that reflect the experiences we have had and the tremendous growth of equestrian activities. 
Please take a moment to note the changes, as they reflect a different approach to how we intend to conduct equestrian activities at our events. 
The most significant changes are intended to streamline the process of authorizing equestrian activities and to address how we conduct individual equestrian authorizations.
It places greater emphasis on individual accountability for equestrians and more opportunity to enjoy equines at events.
With proper management the inherent risks associated with equestrian activities can be minimized in order to allow us to enjoy these magnificent animals.
Please note that the rules relating to certain equestrian activities, i.e.  jousting, mounted combat, etc., that were formerly contained in this handbook have been broken out into a separate set of guidelines in order to allow easier dissemination of information relating to those activities.

# Equestrian Program
## Society Equestrian Officer
1. There shall be a Society Equestrian Officer (SEO) to coordinate equestrian activities and maintain a handbook of regulations with agreement of the governing body within the SCA. The SEO is a deputy to the Society Earl Marshal.
2. The SEO shall oversee the Kingdom Equestrian Officers.
3. The SEO shall have authority to investigate and address incidents involving equestrian activities within the Society. This authority includes the right to sanction individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior, up to and including the removal of equestrian authorizations.
4. The SEO shall have the authority to warrant deputies to assist in conducting equestrian activities. Their authority will be as determined by the SEO, and may include serving as equestrian marshals. Upon the appointment of a new SEO all existing deputy warrants will terminate.
## Kingdom Equestrian Officers
1. Each Kingdom that intends to conduct equestrian activities shall designate a Kingdom Equestrian Officer (KEO). This designation shall be made by the
 Kingdom Earl Marshal and Crown and should consider the individual’s experience and familiarity with equestrian activities within the Society. Each Kingdom is free to title their KEO as they deem fit.
2. The duties of the KEO include:
    1. Oversight of equestrian activities within the Kingdom. The KEO shall have authority to investigate and address incidents involving equestrian activities within their Kingdom. This authority includes the right to sanction individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior, up to and including the removal of equestrian authorizations.
    2. Reporting as follows:
        1. Quarterly reports- The KEO must generate, at minimum, quarterly reports on equestrian activities to the Kingdom Earl Marshal with a collateral report to the Society Equestrian Officer.
        2. Accident reports- In the event of an injury to a person or animal, requiring medical attention, occurring at a Society-sponsored equestrian activity, the KEO will make an oral report to the Kingdom Earl Marshal, Kingdom Seneschal and the SEO within 24 hours of being notified of the incident, followed by a written report to the same within 72 hours delineating the circumstances of the incident. If the injury is to a person, then a copy of the report should also go to the Kingdom Chirurgeon.
    3. Maintaining a roster that indicates those individuals warranted as equestrian marshals, as well as those authorized to participate in equestrian activities.
    4. Monitoring the mandatory notification of the SCA corporate office of SCA equestrian events and payment of appropriate fees.
    5. Maintaining records relating to equestrian matters, including but not limited to all incident reports, and copies of insurance forms after receipt from the Equestrian Marshal in Charge (EqMIC) of equestrian events. The KEO shall verify that waivers are handled in compliance with Kingdom procedures.  Equestrian Handbook, Revised October 10, 2012.
    6. Upon assuming the office of KEO, providing the SEO with current contact information.
3. The KEO shall have the authority to warrant deputies to assist in conducting equestrian activities. Their authority will be as determined by the KEO, and may include serving as equestrian marshals. Upon the appointment of a new KEO all existing deputy warrants will terminate.

## Equestrian Marshals.
1. General Requirements: There are three near-equal priorities in marshaling; safety, fair witness, and showmanship. Overemphasizing any one at the expense of the others will tend to make the equestrian activities less enjoyable for everyone (although, if you must go overboard on one, pick safety).
2. A Marshal may be authorized after demonstrating the ability to oversee equestrian activities, judge an equestrian’s authorization, and inspect weapons and equipment.
3. Unless warranted or rostered by the KEO as an officer of the kingdom, a marshal may not be the Marshal in Charge of an event or sign the paperwork to authorize equestrians.
4. Kingdoms may have other types of Marshals other than Authorized Equestrian Marshals (local Knight Marshals, Constables, etc.) as they see fit. These individuals may be warranted or rostered by the KEO of the Kingdom. However, unless the marshal has undergone a Marshal’s Authorization, they shall not give final approval of the suitability of weapons or equipment, or be involved in the authorization of participants.
5. Only the KEO or a designated Deputy may perform a Marshal’s Authorization.  They must witness the authorization and execute the appropriate paperwork to ensure that the authorization is registered. At a minimum, a Marshal’s Authorization shall include the following:
    1. The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Equestrian Handbook and any additional Kingdom rules or conventions.
    2. The candidate must be willing to enforce the Equestrian Handbook and any additional Kingdom rules or conventions.
    3. The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Society equestrian equipment standards and any additional Kingdom equestrian equipment standards.
    4. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of armor, weapons and equipment used in equestrian activities.
    5. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of equestrians.
    6. The candidate must demonstrate an awareness of the risks inherent to equestrian activities.
    7. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to safely control SCA equestrian activities to minimize those risks.
6. The KEO or a designated Deputy may restrict the ability of an Authorized Marshal to authorize equestrians in whole or for certain activities.
7. All warranted or rostered marshals shall be members of the Society for Creative Anachronism Inc.

 specific waivers may be found at:
 [http://www.sca.org/docs/AdultEquestrianWaivers.pdf.](http://www.sca.org/docs/AdultEquestrianWaivers.pdf)Signage does not apply to
 areas and countries that are covered by affiliate corporations. Please note these
 links are subject to change and the EqMIC must use the most current forms.
 (b) Verify that all required health, safety and transportation documentation has been
 collected from those participating in equestrian activities. This includes
 collecting signatures on the appropriate waivers from those who have a high
 probability of coming into contact with equines. For any event where equidae

Appendix 1- Insurance Ordering Instructions
 The Equestrian Marshal in Charge is responsible for ensuring that the SCA equestrian insurance
 policy has been activated whenever an equine attends an SCA event.
 Ordering an Equestrian Insurance Certificate is mandatory for parades and demos where horses
 and riders are representing the SCA. When ordering the Insurance Certificate, use the name and
 address of the sponsor of the parade or demo.
 Definitions
 Additional insured: An additional party (other than the SCA, Inc.) to whom some of the
 protection of the insurance policy is extended for the duration of the event, and who is as a result
 named in the certificate as being covered by the insurance policy. Normally a site owner will
 require “additional insured” language as part of the site contract if this is necessary.
 Certificate: A document provided by the insurance company certifying that the insurance policy
 has been activated for the event.
 Certificate holder: The site owner or their agent to whom the certificate is intended to
 communicate the existence and validity of the insurance policy.
 Event coordinator: The person requesting the certificate, usually either the Autocrat,
 Equestrian Liaison, or the EqMIC.
 Insurance Fees
 Current ordering instructions and fee schedules can be found at www.sca.org/docs. Scroll
 halfway down the page and find it under the Insurance heading. Read both documents and
 follow the directions. [http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/insurancecert.pdf](http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/insurancecert.pdf)
 Insurance Timeline
 45 days before the event. The EqMIC should verify that the event coordinator has ordered the
 equestrian insurance.
 30 days before the event: Both the request to activate the insurance and the payment must have
 reached the SCA corporate office 30 days before the event in order to avoid the \$100 late fee.
 Less than 30 days before the event: It is recommended the EqMIC should send the KEO a copy
 of the insurance certificate prior to the event.
 Insurance for Practices
 Multiple regularly scheduled practices may rely on a single equestrian insurance certificate (and
 a single activation fee) for an entire calendar year. The following restrictions apply in this case,
 and must be specified when the certificate is ordered:
 1. The location of all practices must be the same.
 2. The dates for all practices must be specified in advance.
 3. The times must be single contiguous time spans of not more than 12 hours occurring on
 non-consecutive days.
 Any variations from the pre-determined practice schedule would constitute a unique event and
 would require an independent activation of the equestrian insurance policy. For more
 information: [http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/eq-insurance.pdf.](http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/eq-insurance.pdf)For ordering instructions:
