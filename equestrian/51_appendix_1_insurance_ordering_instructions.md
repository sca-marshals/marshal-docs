# Appendix 1 - Insurance Ordering Instructions

The Equestrian Marshal in Charge is responsible for ensuring that the SCA equestrian insurance policy has been activated whenever an equine attends an SCA event.

Ordering an Equestrian Insurance Certificate is mandatory for parades and demos where horses and riders are representing the SCA. When ordering the Insurance Certificate, use the name and address of the sponsor of the parade or demo.
