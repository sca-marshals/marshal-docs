### Day of the event
1. Verify all required signage has been posted in view at the event. There is a guide to the waivers and signage that may be found at: [http://www.sca.org/officers/equestrian/waiver\_ann.pdf.](http://www.sca.org/officers/equestrian/waiver_ann.pdf) The general and state specific waivers may be found at: [http://www.sca.org/docs/AdultEquestrianWaivers.pdf.](http://www.sca.org/docs/AdultEquestrianWaivers.pdf) Signage does not apply to areas and countries that are covered by affiliate corporations. Please note these links are subject to change and the EqMIC must use the most current forms.
2. Verify that all required health, safety and transportation documentation has been collected from those participating in equestrian activities. This includes collecting signatures on the appropriate waivers from those who have a high probability of coming into contact with equines. For any event where equidae are to be allowed outside of a designated equestrian area (i.e., allowed to ridden around the site where general activities and attendees are present), an equestrian waiver must be signed in addition to any other required waivers by ALL event attendees (presumably at the gate as they arrive).
3. Overseeing the equestrian activities, including issues of equestrian participation and conduct. The EqMIC has authority to suspend an individualâ€™s right to participate in equestrian activities for the event where they are serving as EqMIC. If necessary, the EqMIC has the authority to advise the seneschal to withdraw SCA sanction from the equestrian portion of an event as outlined in Corpora.
4. Remain on site throughout the duration of an event, practice or demo where horses are present for SCA activities. An EqMIC's duties may be reassigned to a deputy.
5. Post and/or distribute the veterinarian contact list.
