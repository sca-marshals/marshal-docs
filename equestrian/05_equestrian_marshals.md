## Equestrian Marshals
1. General Requirements: There are three near-equal priorities in marshaling; safety, fair witness, and showmanship. Overemphasizing any one at the expense of the others will tend to make the equestrian activities less enjoyable for everyone (although, if you must go overboard on one, pick safety).
2. A Marshal may be authorized after demonstrating the ability to oversee equestrian activities, judge an equestrian’s authorization, and inspect weapons and equipment.
3. Unless warranted or rostered by the KEO as an officer of the kingdom, a marshal may not be the Marshal in Charge of an event or sign the paperwork to authorize equestrians.
4. Kingdoms may have other types of Marshals other than Authorized Equestrian Marshals (local Knight Marshals, Constables, etc.) as they see fit. These individuals may be warranted or rostered by the KEO of the Kingdom. However, unless the marshal has undergone a Marshal’s Authorization, they shall not give final approval of the suitability of weapons or equipment, or be involved in the authorization of participants.
5. Only the KEO or a designated Deputy may perform a Marshal’s Authorization.  They must witness the authorization and execute the appropriate paperwork to ensure that the authorization is registered. At a minimum, a Marshal’s Authorization shall include the following:
    1. The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Equestrian Handbook and any additional Kingdom rules or conventions.
    2. The candidate must be willing to enforce the Equestrian Handbook and any additional Kingdom rules or conventions.
    3. The candidate must have a good working knowledge of the Society equestrian equipment standards and any additional Kingdom equestrian equipment standards.
    4. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of armor, weapons and equipment used in equestrian activities.
    5. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to conduct an inspection of equestrians.
    6. The candidate must demonstrate an awareness of the risks inherent to equestrian activities.
    7. The candidate must demonstrate the ability to safely control SCA equestrian activities to minimize those risks.
6. The KEO or a designated Deputy may restrict the ability of an Authorized Marshal to authorize equestrians in whole or for certain activities.
7. All warranted or rostered marshals shall be members of the Society for Creative Anachronism Inc.
