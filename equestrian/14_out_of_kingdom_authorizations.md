## Out of Kingdom Authorizations
Valid authorization cards shall be accepted outside the issuing kingdom as proof of authorizations. Visitors with a valid authorization card from another kingdom must abide by the equestrian regulations of the kingdom they are visiting. Kingdoms may define additional requirements before renewing an authorization card for a person who has moved into that kingdom from another kingdom.
