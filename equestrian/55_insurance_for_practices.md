## Insurance for Practices
Multiple regularly scheduled practices may rely on a single equestrian insurance certificate (and a single activation fee) for an entire calendar year. The following restrictions apply in this case, and must be specified when the certificate is ordered:

1. The location of all practices must be the same.
2. The dates for all practices must be specified in advance.
3. The times must be single contiguous time spans of not more than 12 hours occurring on non-consecutive days.

Any variations from the pre-determined practice schedule would constitute a unique event and would require an independent activation of the equestrian insurance policy.
