### Specialty Shoots
1.  For clout shoots, the safety zone should extend beyond the target for at least half the target distance, and to each side for at least one-fifth the target distance. It is recommended that the Target Archery Marshal arrange for any archers who are not familiar with clout shooting to practice in advance. They should start with their bows aimed at a low angle and work their way up. This will help prevent overshooting the safety zone.
2.  For flight shoots, the safety zone distance should be at least 300 yards, or the maximum range of the heaviest bow allowed. It is not recommended that a flight shoot be held if space is limited.
3.  For roving courses, the safety zone distance shall be a minimum of one and one-half times the distance to the target. Include special consideration for the angles and distances required for the other targets in the course. No target should be placed within the shooterâ€™s line of sight with another target.
