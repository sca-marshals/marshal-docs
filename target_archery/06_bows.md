## Bows
1.  Bows may be made of any material, provided they are judged safe to shoot by the Target Archery Marshal.
    1.  Bows of unusual materials or construction will be required to pass the inspection of the Kingdom Archery Marshal or designated deputy.
    2. No compound bows are allowed in competition. There will be no exceptions to this prohibition.
2.  Adjustable or fixed sights are not allowed.
    1.  If adjustable or fixed sights are attached, they shall either be removed or made inoperative.
    2. Sighting and/or ranging marks on the limbs or riser are allowed, except in divisions or competitions that exclude their use.
3.  There are no draw weight limits for target archery bows. However, should a Target Archery Marshal observe that an archer is using a bow too heavy or overdrawn for them to safely shoot, the Target Archery Marshal will require the archer to stop using the bow.
4.  No modern spring/flipper rests or plunger buttons are allowed. The use of simple rests is allowed, such as simple one-piece plastic or non-adjustable wire rests; feather, bristle, leather, etc. rests; built out shelves or rests. The use of the shelf in a cutout window is also allowed.
5.  No stabilizers, clickers, or modern string release devices are allowed.
6.  Bows with cut-out risers (i.e., those that can be seen through from the side, often found in take-down bows with metal risers) must have the openings covered so as to present a solid surface and an appearance more in keeping with medieval archery equipment.
