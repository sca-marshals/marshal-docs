## Range Procedures
1.  A Target Archery Marshal shall not allow more archers on a line than can be reasonably and safely supervised.
2.  Experienced archers, known to and approved by the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge, may assist the Target Archery Marshals. When this is done, the ratio of Target Archery Marshals to archers on line may be reduced.
3.  At shoots where many of the archers are inexperienced, it may be necessary to increase the ratio of marshals to archers. This increase need not be as great if experienced archers, as well as Target Archery Marshals, are used to supervise the inexperienced archers.
4.  Conditions around the range and safety zone may require the use of additional Target Archery Marshals or assistants to observe and prevent traffic through the area.
5.  At specialty shoots where the archers are shooting under unusual conditions, such as off-handed, with restricted vision, etc., a one-to-one ratio of Target Archery Marshals and/or assistants to archers may be necessary.
6.  Any conditions or artificial handicaps that create an undue safety hazard, even with an increased Target Archery Marshal/assistant to archer ratio of one to one, are forbidden.
7.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge may remove archers exhibiting unsafe behavior from the range.
