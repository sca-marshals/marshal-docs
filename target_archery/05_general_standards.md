### General Standards
1.  All equipment should be consistent with pre-17th century archery in looks and function. The construction, use, and knowledge of period-style equipment and its safe use are among the primary goals of SCA archery. However, the use of modern equipment is permitted provided it meets the equipment standards spelled out below.
2.  Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted as preventing a Kingdom or branch from making rules requiring the use of period style equipment in a period division or a specific competition. The rules allow the use of modern-style bows, but do not require that all competitions allow their use.
3.  Each archer has the ultimate responsibility for the proper care, inspection and safe use of his/her own weapons, and for knowing and following the SCA and Kingdom target archery rules.
    1.  An archer shall not knowingly use unsafe equipment.
    2. If an archer is unsure of the safety of his/her equipment, he/she shall request the assistance of a Target Archery Marshal in inspecting the equipment.
    3.  The Target Archery Marshal assisting in the inspection shall make a reasonable attempt to locate any unsafe conditions or violations of Kingdom rules and inform the archer of what is found and how to correct it.
    4. The inspection by the Target Archery Marshal may not find all equipment faults and is conducted as a service to all the archers on the line. It does not remove the archersâ€™ primary responsibility for the safe condition of their own equipment.
    5.  Any equipment observed by a Target Archery Marshal to be unsafe shall not be used until it is made safe and is re-inspected by a Target Archery Marshal.
4.  Exceptions to the use of prohibited equipment may be allowed as follows.
    1.  The Kingdom Archery Marshal, or his/her designee, may approve the use of prohibited equipment by class, such as the use of plastic vanes or non-wooden arrows for children's archery. Any such exceptions shall be reported in the Kingdom archery marshal's quarterly report to the SCA Archery Marshal.
    2. The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge of an event may allow the temporary use of prohibited equipment for an archer on an event-by-event basis, such as permitting a new archer to use aluminum arrows with plastic vanes.
    3.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall make necessary allowances for handicapped archers, provided that range safety is not compromised by these allowances.
