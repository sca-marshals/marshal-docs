# Target Archery Marshals

## Requirements for Target Archery Marshals
1.  All Target Archery Marshals shall have knowledge of range safety and of target archery. They shall be familiar with SCA and Kingdom archery rules.
2.  All Target Archery Marshals are officers of the SCA and shall maintain membership as required by the SCA Bylaws, and shall be warranted by their Kingdom as required by Corpora.  

## Responsibilities of Target Archery Marshals:
1.  The Kingdom Archery Marshal shall ensure that the Kingdom target archery rules include, at a minimum, basic range safety standards, archery equipment standards, warranting and reporting procedures for Target Archery Marshals, and injury reporting procedures.
2.  The Kingdom Archery Marshal shall report quarterly to the Society Archery Marshal. This is in addition to any required Kingdom reports.
3.  No target archery activities are to take place at an event unless a target archery marshal is present on the range.
4.  In the event of any disagreement, the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall have complete say and control in resolving the dispute, subject to appeal to the Kingdom Earl Marshal or the Crown. Appeals may be made via the appropriate procedures as specified in Kingdom and SCA law and policy.
5.  All archers and marshals should explicitly follow the commands of the Target Archery Marshal who is in charge of their range. Failure to follow the Target Archery Marshal’s instructions may result in removal from the range.
6.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge may request the assistance of other Marshals in the performance of his/her duties. However, the responsibility for safely setting up and running the range remains with the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge.
7.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge or the assisting Marshals have the authority to inspect all bows and arrows/bolts for safety and compliance with Kingdom rules.
    1.  Equipment that does not meet the standards laid out in the rules shall not be used. (The Marshal-in-Charge may make exceptions - see section 4)
    2. Equipment deemed unsafe by the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall not be used.  
8.  While on duty, Target Archery Marshals are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to enforce the rules and safety standards for archery activities or events.
9.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge at an event shall report, to the Kingdom Archery Marshal and any others required by Kingdom law and policy, all injuries requiring professional medical treatment as a result of activity on or about the range.
10. The Kingdom Archery Marshal shall report to the Society Archery Marshal any archery-related injuries that required professional medical treatment as well as any potentially dangerous circumstances or incidents involving archery in the Kingdom and their outcome.
11. As part of their duties, Target Archery Marshals are responsible for ensuring that all archers are familiar with and comply with the SCA and Kingdom target archery rules. This may be done either by verbal briefings or by requiring the archers to read the posted rules.

## Equipment Standards
### General Standards
1.  All equipment should be consistent with pre-17th century archery in looks and function. The construction, use, and knowledge of period-style equipment and its safe use are among the primary goals of SCA archery. However, the use of modern equipment is permitted provided it meets the equipment standards spelled out below.
2.  Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted as preventing a Kingdom or branch from making rules requiring the use of period style equipment in a period division or a specific competition. The rules allow the use of modern-style bows, but do not require that all competitions allow their use.
3.  Each archer has the ultimate responsibility for the proper care, inspection and safe use of his/her own weapons, and for knowing and following the SCA and Kingdom target archery rules.
    1.  An archer shall not knowingly use unsafe equipment.
    2. If an archer is unsure of the safety of his/her equipment, he/she shall request the assistance of a Target Archery Marshal in inspecting the equipment.
    3.  The Target Archery Marshal assisting in the inspection shall make a reasonable attempt to locate any unsafe conditions or violations of Kingdom rules and inform the archer of what is found and how to correct it.
    4. The inspection by the Target Archery Marshal may not find all equipment faults and is conducted as a service to all the archers on the line. It does not remove the archers’ primary responsibility for the safe condition of their own equipment.
    5.  Any equipment observed by a Target Archery Marshal to be unsafe shall not be used until it is made safe and is re-inspected by a Target Archery Marshal.
4.  Exceptions to the use of prohibited equipment may be allowed as follows.
    1.  The Kingdom Archery Marshal, or his/her designee, may approve the use of prohibited equipment by class, such as the use of plastic vanes or non-wooden arrows for children's archery. Any such exceptions shall be reported in the Kingdom archery marshal's quarterly report to the SCA Archery Marshal.
    2. The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge of an event may allow the temporary use of prohibited equipment for an archer on an event-by-event basis, such as permitting a new archer to use aluminum arrows with plastic vanes.
    3.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall make necessary allowances for handicapped archers, provided that range safety is not compromised by these allowances.

## Bows
1.  Bows may be made of any material, provided they are judged safe to shoot by the Target Archery Marshal.
    1.  Bows of unusual materials or construction will be required to pass the inspection of the Kingdom Archery Marshal or designated deputy.
    2. No compound bows are allowed in competition. There will be no exceptions to this prohibition.
2.  Adjustable or fixed sights are not allowed.
    1.  If adjustable or fixed sights are attached, they shall either be removed or made inoperative.
    2. Sighting and/or ranging marks on the limbs or riser are allowed, except in divisions or competitions that exclude their use.
3.  There are no draw weight limits for target archery bows. However, should a Target Archery Marshal observe that an archer is using a bow too heavy or overdrawn for them to safely shoot, the Target Archery Marshal will require the archer to stop using the bow.
4.  No modern spring/flipper rests or plunger buttons are allowed. The use of simple rests is allowed, such as simple one-piece plastic or non-adjustable wire rests; feather, bristle, leather, etc. rests; built out shelves or rests. The use of the shelf in a cutout window is also allowed.
5.  No stabilizers, clickers, or modern string release devices are allowed.
6.  Bows with cut-out risers (i.e., those that can be seen through from the side, often found in take-down bows with metal risers) must have the openings covered so as to present a solid surface and an appearance more in keeping with medieval archery equipment.

## Crossbows
1.  No non-period center-shot trackless crossbow styles are allowed.
2.  No compound prods or break-cocking crossbow styles are allowed in competition. There will be no exceptions to this prohibition.
3.  No archer shall continue to use a crossbow that is observed by a Target Archery Marshal to have too heavy a draw for the archer to use safely.
4.  Prods of most materials are allowed, provided they are judged safe to shoot by the Target Archery Marshal. Prods of unusual material or construction will be required to pass the inspection of the Kingdom Archery Marshal or a designated deputy.
5.  Simple rear sights are allowed. Front sights are not allowed.
6.  Stocks may be of any material.
7.  If a modern stock with openings that can be seen through from the side is used, all such openings must be filled or covered to appear more period. Openings that are intended for gripping the stock need not be covered. Openings may be covered with tape, leather, cloth, etc.

## Strings
1.  All strings shall be appropriate in length and strength for the bow type and weight. Linen, silk, artificial sinew, and any modern bowstring materials are acceptable, as long as strings are properly constructed.
    1.  Strings that have become knotted, or those that have been repaired by knotting strands together, shall not be used. This rule does not forbid those string designs that incorporate knots, such as a bowyer’s knot, in their original design.
2.  A nocking point may be attached to the string. It may be made of metal or tied on. A single nocking point is allowed.
    1.  The nocking point may consist of one or two locators, which may be of any type.
    2. The locators may not extend above or below the arrow nock in such a way that they are used as sighting mechanisms.
3.  Peep sights or kisser buttons mounted on the string are not allowed.

## Arrows and Bolts
1.  All shafts shall be of wood or of bamboo-like materials.
2.  Both self and footed shafts are permitted.
3.  No broadheads or tips that cause excessive damage to the targets shall be used, except for special competitions using these heads with the permission of the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge and the Kingdom Archery Marshal.
4.  Fletched arrows and bolts shall have feathers or other pre-17th century material. Plastic vanes are not allowed.
5.  Nocks for arrows, and caps, rings, or nocks for bolts may be of any material, provided they are securely attached.

# Range Safety
## Range Set-Up
1.  The range and safety zone must be clearly marked off. This may be done by the use of ropes, poles, signs, tapes, etc.
2.  At events where large numbers of archers are shooting, the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall be easily identifiable.
3.  There shall be a safety zone behind and to the sides of the shooting line and targets. It shall be of reasonable size to prevent injury to bystanders. It must be free of traffic, campsites, list fields, parking areas, or other hazards.
    1.  The distance of the safety zone behind the targets may be reduced if there is a hill, permanent backstop, archery netting, etc., that will stop stray arrows.
4.  If there are roads or paths within the safety zone or range, they shall be blocked off to traffic at both ends during shooting.
5.  The shooting line shall be clearly marked. It must not present a tripping hazard.
6.  So that no archer unduly endangers another by shooting from behind, all archers will line up the same way, either all toeing the shooting line or all straddling it. Archers shooting from prone, kneeling, or seated positions shall have the head of their arrow or bolt, at full draw, in the same line as the other archers on the line and should be placed together at one end of the line.
7.  Each archer shall have, at a minimum, three feet of space on the line, with recommended spacing being at least 4 feet. Other shots with special circumstances may require other spacing and heightened Target Archery Marshal supervision.
8.  During shooting, all spectators shall remain outside the marked safety zones and/or at least 10 feet to the rear of the shooting line.

## Range Procedures
1.  A Target Archery Marshal shall not allow more archers on a line than can be reasonably and safely supervised.
2.  Experienced archers, known to and approved by the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge, may assist the Target Archery Marshals. When this is done, the ratio of Target Archery Marshals to archers on line may be reduced.
3.  At shoots where many of the archers are inexperienced, it may be necessary to increase the ratio of marshals to archers. This increase need not be as great if experienced archers, as well as Target Archery Marshals, are used to supervise the inexperienced archers.
4.  Conditions around the range and safety zone may require the use of additional Target Archery Marshals or assistants to observe and prevent traffic through the area.
5.  At specialty shoots where the archers are shooting under unusual conditions, such as off-handed, with restricted vision, etc., a one-to-one ratio of Target Archery Marshals and/or assistants to archers may be necessary.
6.  Any conditions or artificial handicaps that create an undue safety hazard, even with an increased Target Archery Marshal/assistant to archer ratio of one to one, are forbidden.
7.  The Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge may remove archers exhibiting unsafe behavior from the range.

## Range Commands
1.  The Target Archery Marshal will call the archers to the line.
2.  The Target Archery Marshal will look to see that the range and line are clear and safe.
3.  The Target Archery Marshal will call out "range clear" or the equivalent, and wait momentarily for any responses.
4.  If all is clear, then the order "loose", "loose at will", or the equivalent will be given.
5.  When finished shooting, the archers are to lower their bows, step back from the line, and wait until the order to retrieve is given.
6.  When all archers are done, the Target Archery Marshal will call "bows down”, "cease", or the equivalent and wait for compliance.
7.  When all weapons are down, the Target Archery Marshal will give the command "retrieve arrows" or the equivalent.
8.  In the case of a serious safety problem on the range such as someone entering, or about to enter, the target or safety zone, the call "hold" shall be given by anyone noticing the problem. All archers are to remove the arrows or bolts from their weapons.

## Rules of the Line
1.  Ask the Target Archery Marshal for permission before filling in on the line.
2.  If "hold" is called, an archer should lower his/her bow, remove his/her arrow or bolt and pay heed to the Target Archery Marshal's instructions.
3.  If an archer sees an immediate problem, he/she should call “hold” and inform the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge.
4.  If an archer sees a potential problem, he/she should report it to a Target Archery Marshal.
5.  All archers shall follow the instructions of the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge and of Target Archery Marshals assisting on the line.
6.  Archers should step back once he/she has completed shooting.

## Safety Rules
1.  Archers should always remember the potential danger of their weapons.
2.  No arrows or bolts should be nocked when anyone is in front of the shooting line.
3.  No archer should discharge a bow when anyone is downrange.
4.  No archer should shoot while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

# Additional Recommendations
## Miscellaneous Equipment
1.  Any type of quiver may be used, with the exception of one that attaches to the bow.
2.  It is recommended that arm and/or finger protection be used, according to the preference of the archer.
3.  It is strongly recommended that the ends of the string be served, and that a serving cover the nocking area of the string. It should be noted that Japanese and Flemish style strings, which are rarely served at the ends, are acceptable.

## Range Set-Up
It is recommended that the range and safety zone be posted with signs in addition to the required perimeter markers of ropes, poles, etc.

### Suggested Range Dimensions
The following are suggested dimensions for the range and safety zones for target and specialty competitions. These are general guidelines. The actual sizes may vary, depending on terrain, the archers, and other conditions. It is better to err on the side of safety with too much space than not enough.

### Target Shoots
1.  The safety zone behind the farthest target should extend at least 40 yards back, or for half the distance from the line to the farthest target, whichever is greater.
2.  For shoots of 50 yards or less, the safety zone to the sides of the shooting line and targets should extend outward at a 30- to 45-degree angle from both ends of the shooting line to a line even with the furthest target, and continue straight back from there to the required distance.
3.  For shoots of over 50 yards, the safety zone to the sides of the shooting line and targets should extend outward at a 30- to 45-degree angle from both ends of the shooting line to a line 50 yards away or one-quarter the distance to the far end of the safety zone, whichever is greater, and continue straight back from there to the required distance.

### Specialty Shoots
1.  For clout shoots, the safety zone should extend beyond the target for at least half the target distance, and to each side for at least one-fifth the target distance. It is recommended that the Target Archery Marshal arrange for any archers who are not familiar with clout shooting to practice in advance. They should start with their bows aimed at a low angle and work their way up. This will help prevent overshooting the safety zone.
2.  For flight shoots, the safety zone distance should be at least 300 yards, or the maximum range of the heaviest bow allowed. It is not recommended that a flight shoot be held if space is limited.
3.  For roving courses, the safety zone distance shall be a minimum of one and one-half times the distance to the target. Include special consideration for the angles and distances required for the other targets in the course. No target should be placed within the shooter’s line of sight with another target.

## Range Courtesy
1.  When going to retrieve arrows, first pick up any of your arrows lying short of the target.
2.  Remove arrows by "worrying" them out. Do not yank them out.
3.  Do not handle anyone's equipment unless you have asked for and received the owner's permission.
4.  Do not remove other archers' arrows unless you have asked for and received the owner’s permission.
5.  Keep distraction of the archers on the shooting line to a minimum.
