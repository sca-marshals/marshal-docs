## Miscellaneous Equipment
1.  Any type of quiver may be used, with the exception of one that attaches to the bow.
2.  It is recommended that arm and/or finger protection be used, according to the preference of the archer.
3.  It is strongly recommended that the ends of the string be served, and that a serving cover the nocking area of the string. It should be noted that Japanese and Flemish style strings, which are rarely served at the ends, are acceptable.
