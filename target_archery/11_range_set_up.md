## Range Set-Up
1.  The range and safety zone must be clearly marked off. This may be done by the use of ropes, poles, signs, tapes, etc.
2.  At events where large numbers of archers are shooting, the Target Archery Marshal-in-Charge shall be easily identifiable.
3.  There shall be a safety zone behind and to the sides of the shooting line and targets. It shall be of reasonable size to prevent injury to bystanders. It must be free of traffic, campsites, list fields, parking areas, or other hazards.
    1.  The distance of the safety zone behind the targets may be reduced if there is a hill, permanent backstop, archery netting, etc., that will stop stray arrows.
4.  If there are roads or paths within the safety zone or range, they shall be blocked off to traffic at both ends during shooting.
5.  The shooting line shall be clearly marked. It must not present a tripping hazard.
6.  So that no archer unduly endangers another by shooting from behind, all archers will line up the same way, either all toeing the shooting line or all straddling it. Archers shooting from prone, kneeling, or seated positions shall have the head of their arrow or bolt, at full draw, in the same line as the other archers on the line and should be placed together at one end of the line.
7.  Each archer shall have, at a minimum, three feet of space on the line, with recommended spacing being at least 4 feet. Other shots with special circumstances may require other spacing and heightened Target Archery Marshal supervision.
8.  During shooting, all spectators shall remain outside the marked safety zones and/or at least 10 feet to the rear of the shooting line.
