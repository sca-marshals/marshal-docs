### Target Shoots
1.  The safety zone behind the farthest target should extend at least 40 yards back, or for half the distance from the line to the farthest target, whichever is greater.
2.  For shoots of 50 yards or less, the safety zone to the sides of the shooting line and targets should extend outward at a 30- to 45-degree angle from both ends of the shooting line to a line even with the furthest target, and continue straight back from there to the required distance.
3.  For shoots of over 50 yards, the safety zone to the sides of the shooting line and targets should extend outward at a 30- to 45-degree angle from both ends of the shooting line to a line 50 yards away or one-quarter the distance to the far end of the safety zone, whichever is greater, and continue straight back from there to the required distance.
