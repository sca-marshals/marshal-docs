## Strings
1.  All strings shall be appropriate in length and strength for the bow type and weight. Linen, silk, artificial sinew, and any modern bowstring materials are acceptable, as long as strings are properly constructed.
    1.  Strings that have become knotted, or those that have been repaired by knotting strands together, shall not be used. This rule does not forbid those string designs that incorporate knots, such as a bowyerâ€™s knot, in their original design.
2.  A nocking point may be attached to the string. It may be made of metal or tied on. A single nocking point is allowed.
    1.  The nocking point may consist of one or two locators, which may be of any type.
    2. The locators may not extend above or below the arrow nock in such a way that they are used as sighting mechanisms.
3.  Peep sights or kisser buttons mounted on the string are not allowed.
