# Procedures for Grievances and Sanctions
Usually the combatants are more than willing to correct any problems or breaches of the rules pointed out by a marshal. This is the desired solution: get the problem fixed. However, occasionally a marshal must take action. In the unhappy event that you find it necessary, here is how you shall proceed. In order of preference:

1.  Point out the violation (missing armor, grappling during combat, etc.) and ask the fighter to correct it.
2.  In the case of missing or inadequate armor, do not allow the combatant onto the field until it has been fixed.
3.  In the case of violation of the rules during combat, ask the combatant to leave the field, and do not allow combat to resume until he or she has cooled off. This particularly includes removing from the field anyone who has lost his or her temper.
4.  If you need support, call on (in order):
    1.  Any other marshals who are present (especially the marshal-in-charge).
    2.  A regional, deputy, or principality Earl or Knight Marshal.
    3.  The kingdom Earl Marshal
    4.  The local Seneschal
    5.  The principality or kingdom seneschal
    6.  The Crown
5.  If the violation cannot be stopped, convince the marshal-in-charge and the local seneschal to end the event.
6.  In any case where voluntary correction is not made after the problem has been pointed out, a detailed written report shall be made to the Earl Marshal as soon as possible after the event. In cases where the fighter has made corrections voluntarily a report should be sent to the Earl Marshal if a pattern of problems, even minor ones from the same fighter is occurring.
