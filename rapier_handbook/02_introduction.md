## INTRODUCTION
These rules set fundamental standards for rapier combat in the SCA. 
They are designed to allow use by the Kingdoms of the Society as basic rules, to which Kingdom-specific preferences (such as the weapons used) can be added. 
In keeping with Corpora, Kingdoms retain the right to add rules which establish more restrictive standards. 
All fighters and marshals are responsible for knowing these rules, as well as the additional rules of their Kingdom.  

Rules are designed to promote safe rapier combat in the Society. However, no matter how clear or accurate, rules cannot replace common sense, good judgment, and concern for the participants. 
If a question arises when applying these standards, choose the answer that promotes the greatest degree of safety for all participants.
