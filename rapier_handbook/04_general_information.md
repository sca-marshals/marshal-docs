2. All combatants, prior to every combat or practice, shall ensure their equipment is safe, in good working order and has been inspected by a member of the Kingdom Marshallate authorized to inspect rapier gear.
3. At interkingdom events, for any given Kingdom's tourney, guest combatants shall meet SCA standards for protective gear, but shall comply with whatever weapons standards are being used by the host kingdom for that tourney.
4. Unless otherwise directed by Kingdom Law, the Crown's representative upon the field and in all matters dealing with Rapier Combat is the Earl Marshal, then the Kingdom Rapier Marshal, then, by delegation, members of the Kingdom Rapier Marshallate.
5. There are three categories of rapier combat, each requiring separate authorization. Each Kingdom can decide which categories of rapier combat they will permit in their rules. These categories are:

    Except where noted, all rules apply to all three forms of rapier combat. One of the major differences in the three forms is the allowable blades, which are specified later in this document.
