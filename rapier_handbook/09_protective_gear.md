## PROTECTIVE GEAR
1. TERMS
    1. Materials are listed in order of increasing resistance.
    2. Abrasion-resistant material: material that will withstand normal combat stresses (such as being snagged by an unbroken blade) without tearing. Examples include, but are not limited to:
        * broadcloth
        * a single layer of heavy poplin cloth (35% cotton, 65% polyester; "trigger" cloth)
        * sweat pants
        * opaque cotton, poly-cotton or lycra/spandex mix tights

         Nylon pantyhose and cotton gauze shirts are examples of unacceptable materials.

    3. Puncture-resistant material: any fabric or combination of fabrics that will predictably withstand puncture. Examples include, but are not limited to:
        * four-ounce (1.60 mm) leather
        * four layers of heavy poplin cloth
        * ballistic nylon rated to at least 550 Newtons
        * commercial fencing clothing rated to at least 550 Newtons

        Kevlar is not an acceptable material, as it degrades rapidly. These materials need only be tested at the marshalâ€™s discretion; all other materials must be tested the first time new gear is used, or if no marshal on the field knows a given piece of gear to have been tested. (Refer to [Appendix - Testing Standards for SCA Rapier Combat](#testing-standards-for-sca-rapier-combat)).
    4. Rigid Material: puncture-resistant material that will not significantly flex, spread apart, or deform under pressure of 12 Kg applied by a standard mask tester, repeatedly to any single point. Examples of rigid material are:
 
        * 22 gauge stainless steel (0.8 mm)
        * 20 gauge mild steel (1.0 mm)
        * 16 gauge aluminum, copper, or brass (1.6 mm)
        * one layer of hardened heavy leather (8 ounce, 3.18 mm)

2. ARMOR REQUIREMENTS
    1. The following are the Society norms for protective gear. Kingdoms enacting more stringent standards shall weigh the benefits of more rigorous penetration coverage against the risks of heat illness, exhaustion, and stroke due to heavier or more confining gear.
    2. HEAD AND NECK
        1. The front and top of the head must be covered by rigid material to below the jaw line and behind the ears. Standard 12 kg fencing masks are known to meet this standard. If built to this standard, fencing helms are also acceptable.
        2.  The face must be covered by either 12 kilogram mesh (e.g, a standard fencing mask) or perforated metal. Such metal must not have holes larger than 1/8" (3 mm) in diameter, with a minimum offset of 3/16" (5 mm) and shall also meet the definition of rigid material.
        3.  Masks and helms must be secured to the fighter, so that they cannot be easily removed or dislodged during combat. The combination of snug fit and the spring-tongue in a conventional fencing mask is NOT sufficient, by itself, to secure the mask to the fighter.
        4.  Both modern fencing masks and rapier helms, when inspected, shall comply with the rigid material standard, provisions on facial coverage, and shall show no evidence of impending failure (e.g., rust which weakens the metal involved, dents or other defects which spread open mesh, broken weld points, etc). If there is concern about the face mesh of a modern fencing mask, it should be tested using a standard commercial 12kg mask punch. Marshals doing the testing shall be trained in the use of the punch. The Kingdom Rapier Marshals may elect to designate certain deputies to administer such testing.
        5.  The rest of the head and neck must be covered by at least puncture resistant material.
        6.  For heavy rapier and cut and thrust rapier, additional throat protection is required; it shall consist of rigid material, as noted above, covering the entire throat, and shall be backed by either puncture resistant material (as a hood), one quarter inch (1/4") (6 mm) of open-cell foam, or their equivalents. The cervical vertebrae shall also be protected by rigid material, provided by some combination of gorget, helm, and/or hood insert.
        7.  For cut and thrust rapier, the back of the head must also be covered by rigid material, as noted above sufficient to protect against percussive cuts.
    3. TORSO AND OTHER KILLING ZONES
        1.  The entire torso (the chest, back, abdomen, groin, and sides up to and including the armpits) must be covered with puncture-resistant material.
        2.  Acceptable minimum armpit coverage is provided by a triangle extending from the armpit seam, covering the lower half of the sleeve at the seam, and extending down the inner/under arm, one-third the distance to the fighter's elbow.
        3.  Male fighters shall wear rigid groin protection. Any ventilation holes large enough to admit a broken blade must be covered from the outside with at least puncture-resistant material. Female fighters shall wear puncture resistant groin protection.
    3. ARMS AND LEGS
        1.  Hands shall be protected by gloves, made of abrasion resistant material, that overlap any sleeve openings as below. Feet shall be protected by boots, shoes, or sandals, comprised of at least abrasion-resistant material.
        2.  Abrasion-resistant material is required on arms (save as noted above for armpits), legs, and any area not otherwise mentioned in these rules.
        3.  No skin shall be bared. There shall be sufficient overlap between separate pieces of protective clothing, regardless of the fighter's stance or movements, that the minimum protection for that body area be preserved.
        4.  For cut and thrust rapier, elbows must be further protected by a minimum of an athletic pad or equivalent materials.
