### WEAPONS AND PARRYING DEVICES
1. GENERAL
    1. Sharp points, edges or corners are not allowed anywhere on any equipment.
    2. All equipment must be able to safely withstand combat stresses.
    3. Equipment that is likely to break a blade or damage other equipment is prohibited.
         1.  Light rapier does not permit any equipment that has small rigid openings large enough to admit a properly tipped light rapier blade (i.e. small holes in bell guards, small openings in a cage or swept hilt, any design which has acute angles where a blade could easily be wedged and bent). Knuckle bows are deemed safe for use with light rapier blades.
2. BLADES
    1.  If a blade meets the criteria below, it is considered acceptable for use unless specifically restricted from use by the Deputy Society Marshal for Rapier Combat. If a blade does not meet the criteria established below, it may not be used for any form of rapier combat in the Society, unless it is permitted by the Deputy Society Marshal for Rapier Combat.  Exceptions (permitted blades or restricted blades) will be maintained in [Appendix - "Exceptions to Allowed Blades Rules"](#exceptions-to-allowed-blades-rules).
    2. All blades are subject to the following:
        1. Blades must be made of steel
        2. Blades must be no longer than 48" as measured from the tip to the top of the tang (i.e. where the tang and forte meet)
        3.  Blades must be reasonably flexible as defined in [Appendix - "Blade Flexibility Testing"](#blade-flexibility-testing).
        4.  Light rapier blades longer than 18” must be a foil blade, epee blade, or similar variant (such as a double-wide epee or musketeer blades) from an established commercial manufacturer. Light rapier blades 18” or shorter need only meet the requirements previously listed.
        5.  Blades with a cross-section similar to a foil or epee (ie., foils, epees, double-wide epees, musketeers and flexi-daggers) are not allowed in Heavy Rapier, nor Cut & Thrust combat.
        6.  Steel blades will not be altered by grinding, cutting, heating, hammering, or other actions that could significantly alter their temper, flexibility or durability. Normal combat stresses and blade care do not violate this rule. Exceptions are:
            1. The tang of the weapon may be altered.
            2. Heavy rapier and cut and thrust rapier blades may be shortened so long as they maintain acceptable flexibility.
            3.  A nut or other blunt metal object designed to spread impact may be welded to the tip of heavy rapier and cut and thrust rapier blades so long as care is taken to prevent damage to the temper of the blade. The blunt object will still need some form of coverage, per 2.B.ix. below.
        7.  Rigid steel "parrying-only" daggers such as those made from cut down blades will not be allowed.
        8.  All blade ends must be capped with rubber, plastic, or leather.
            1. Tips will have a blunt striking surface, presenting a cross-section of at least 3/8 inch (9 mm) diameter.
            2. Tips must be firmly taped or glued in place. The tip must be of a color contrasting with the blade so that the tip's absence is readily apparent. If tape is used, it must contrast with both blade and tip.
        9.  Any blade with kinks, sharp bends, or cracks shall not be used. Steel blades that develop these defects cannot be repaired and must be retired. Light rapier blades or flexidaggers with "S" curves shall not be used unless they can be properly re-curved.
        10.  Weapons may use a hand guard such as a cup hilt, swept hilt or quillons and knuckle bow. The ends of quillons must be blunt.
        11.  Orthopedic (or "Pistol") grips will not be used unless the fighter has approval for medical reasons, supported by documentation from their health care provider.

3. PARRYING DEVICES:
    1. Solid parrying devices will be made of sturdy, lightweight materials, resistant to breakage and splintering.
    2. Soft, non-rigid devices such as cloaks may be made of cloth, foam, leather and similar materials. They may be weighted with soft material such as rope or rolled cloth; they shall not be weighted with any rigid material nor with materials which are heavy enough to turn the device into a flail or impact weapon.
    3. Devices that predictably cause entangling of an opponent or their equipment, either by design or by repeated mishap, are not allowed.
    4. Offensive bucklers will be considered non-standard devices. These devices must be approved on a case by case basis, in accordance with rules established by each kingdom's Rapier Marshallate. An opponent may decline to face non-standard devices without forfeiting a bout. Offensive bucklers shall be made of soft flexible materials such as cloth, tape, foam and golf tubes.

4. PROJECTILE WEAPONS
    1. Kingdoms may permit combat archery, throwing weapons, and/or mock-gunnery gear (such as rubber-band guns) to be used in rapier melee combat, as long as safety standards for those arts are met.
    2. The use of any projectile weapon is forbidden within formal rapier Tournament lists (single combat), or in any situation where spectators cannot be separated from the potential line of fire by more than the effective range of the projectile weapons to be used.
