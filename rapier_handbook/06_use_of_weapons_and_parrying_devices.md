#### USE OF WEAPONS AND PARRYING DEVICES
1. Valid blows are struck by: thrusting with the point of the blade (thrust) or sliding the edge of the blade by drawing (draw cut).
    1. Kingdoms have the option of including sliding the edge of the blade by pushing (push cut) and/or placing the tip of the blade upon and then drawing it across an opponent (tip cut) as valid blows.
    2. Cut and thrust rapier also includes the use of percussive cuts as a valid blow.  Percussive cuts must always be delivered with sufficient control so as not to injure the opponent while still delivering the necessary impact for a valid cut.
2. Chopping or hacking blows are not permitted in light or heavy rapier combat. For cut and thrust rapier, they still must be delivered with sufficient control. Fast circular movements (such as moulinets) may be used to place a blade for allowable cuts in all three categories of rapier combat.
3. Parrying devices may be used to move, deflect, or immobilize an opponent's weapon or parrying device, so long as such use does not endanger the safety of the combatants.
4. Striking an opponent with any part of a weapon or parrying device not approved for that purpose is prohibited.
