## Axes
1.  Axes should be of a size and weight which allows them to be thrown safely and easily.
2.  The handles of all axes should be firmly attached.
3.  Some axes are designed to allow the head to slide up a tapered handle and pressure-fit on. The heads will come off if they are pushed toward the butt of the handle. When the axe is used, the head is forced into place and seats tightly. The inspecting marshal should ensure that the head does indeed seat tightly and will not slip over the taper.
4.  The haft cannot have any major cracks.
5.  The haft cannot have any burrs or rough surfaces that can cut or give splinters to an unprotected hand upon release.
