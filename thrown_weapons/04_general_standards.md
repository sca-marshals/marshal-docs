## General Standards
1.  Each thrower has the final responsibility for the proper care and safe use of their weapons, and for knowing and following their Kingdom’s thrown-weapon rules.
    1.  A thrower shall not knowingly use unsafe equipment.
    2. If a thrower is unsure of the safety of their equipment they shall request the assistance of a Thrown-Weapons Marshal in inspecting their equipment.
    3.  The Thrown-Weapons Marshal assisting in the inspection shall make a reasonable attempt to locate any unsafe conditions or violations of Kingdom rules and inform the thrower of what is found and how to correct it.
    4. The inspection by the Thrown-Weapons Marshal may not find all equipment faults and is conducted as a service to all the throwers on the line. It does not remove the throwers’ primary responsibility for the safe condition of their own equipment.
    5.  Any equipment observed by a Thrown-Weapons Marshal to be unsafe shall not be used until it is made safe and re-inspected by a Thrown-Weapons Marshal.
2.  Equipment and safety standards vary greatly depending upon the type of thrown weapon and the techniques that are used to throw the weapon. All inspections and decisions should be made with the following considerations:
    1.  How will the user be throwing the weapon? For example, will a knife be thrown by the handle or the blade?
    2. Is the weapon designed to be thrown?
    3.  Is the weapon sturdy enough to be thrown?
    4. How sharp is the blade?
    5.  How balanced is the weapon? If the weapon is so unbalanced that it would be awkward to swing, the thrower should demonstrate that it can be thrown safely.
    6.  Is the weapon either excessively light or heavy in weight?
    7. Is the weapon either excessively short or long?
    8. Is the handle taped? If a weapons handle has been taped or reinforced, it must have been done for a reason. Ask the owner about it. Give it extra attention; make sure that it is structurally sound and safe.  Duct tape is not an acceptable fix for a handle with a major crack. If it cannot be inspected due to coverings, it should be failed.
