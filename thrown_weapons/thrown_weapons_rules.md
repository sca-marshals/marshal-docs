Equipment Standards
 General Standards
 1.
 Each thrower has the final responsibility for the proper care and safe use of their weapons, and for
 knowing and following their Kingdom’s thrown-weapon rules.
 a.
 A thrower shall not knowingly use unsafe equipment.
 b. If a thrower is unsure of the safety of their equipment they shall request the assistance of a Thrown-
 Weapons Marshal in inspecting their equipment.
 c.
 The Thrown-Weapons Marshal assisting in the inspection shall make a reasonable attempt to locate
 any unsafe conditions or violations of Kingdom rules and inform the thrower of what is found and how
 to correct it.
 d. The inspection by the Thrown-Weapons Marshal may not find all equipment faults and is conducted
 as a service to all the throwers on the line. It does not remove the throwers’ primary responsibility for
 the safe condition of their own equipment.
 e.
 Any equipment observed by a Thrown-Weapons Marshal to be unsafe shall not be used until it is
 made safe and re-inspected by a Thrown-Weapons Marshal.
 2.
 Equipment and safety standards vary greatly depending upon the type of thrown weapon and the
 techniques that are used to throw the weapon. All inspections and decisions should be made with the
 following considerations:
 a.
 How will the user be throwing the weapon? For example, will a knife be thrown by the handle or the
 blade?
 b. Is the weapon designed to be thrown?
 c.
 Is the weapon sturdy enough to be thrown?
 d. How sharp is the blade?
 e.
 How balanced is the weapon? If the weapon is so unbalanced that it would be awkward to swing, the
 thrower should demonstrate that it can be thrown safely.
 f.
 Is the weapon either excessively light or heavy in weight?
 g. Is the weapon either excessively short or long?
 h. Is the handle taped? If a weapons handle has been taped or reinforced, it must have been done for a
 reason. Ask the owner about it. Give it extra attention; make sure that it is structurally sound and safe.
 Duct tape is not an acceptable fix for a handle with a major crack. If it cannot be inspected due to
 coverings, it should be failed.
 September 2003

Knives
 1.
 Throwing knives should be of a size and weight which allows them to be thrown safely and easily.
 2.
 The handle of the knife should be firmly attached.
 3.
 The throwing surface should be free of burrs or protrusions that can cut or injure an unprotected hand
 upon release.
 Axes
 1.
 Axes should be of a size and weight which allows them to be thrown safely and easily.
 2.
 The handles of all axes should be firmly attached.
 3.
 Some axes are designed to allow the head to slide up a tapered handle and pressure-fit on. The heads
 will come off if they are pushed toward the butt of the handle. When the axe is used, the head is forced
 into place and seats tightly. The inspecting marshal should ensure that the head does indeed seat tightly
 and will not slip over the taper.
 4.
 The haft cannot have any major cracks.
 5.
 The haft cannot have any burrs or rough surfaces that can cut or give splinters to an unprotected hand
 upon release.
 Spears
 1.
 Spears may not be excessively long or heavy.
 2.
 Spear heads must be firmly attached to the shaft of the spear.
 3.
 The shaft cannot have any burrs or rough surfaces that can cut or give splinters to an unprotected hand
 upon release.
 4.
 The shaft must be sound and without major cracks.
 Specialized Throwing Weapons
 Specialized throwing weapons are any weapons that have been designed with more than one impact surface
 to increase the chances of the weapon sticking in the target. Because they come in a variety of shapes and
 sizes, they must be judged on an individual basis.

Range Safety
 Safety is of primary importance.
 Range Set-Up
 1.
 The range will be identifiable at all times. Rope, tape, poles, etc., may be used to mark off the range and
 the safety area
 2.
 The Marshal-in-Charge should be easily identified.
 3.
 The throwing line is the closest position from which a throw can be made.
 4.
 Hard targets for knives and axes should be at least 10 feet away from the throwing line (down-range). A
 hard target is any target made of materials that provide a solid resistance. This includes, but is not limited
 to, logs, plywood, etc.
 5.
 Hard targets for spears should be at least 20 feet away from the throwing line.
 6.
 Soft targets for spears should be at least 10 feet away from the throwing line. A soft target is any target
 made of materials that do not provide solid resistance. This includes, but is not limited to, hay bales,
 styrofoam, etc.
 7.
 A safe zone shall be established that takes into consideration the weapons being used and the range
 conditions. The safe zone includes the area behind and to the sides of the targets as well as behind the
 throwing line.
 Range Procedures and Commands
 1.
 The Thrown-Weapons Marshal will call the throwers to the line.
 2.
 The Thrown-Weapons Marshal will look to see that all is clear down-range.
 3.
 The Thrown-Weapons Marshal will look to see that nobody is directly behind the throwers, in the path of
 the swing, or in the arc traversed by the swing.
 4.
 The Thrown-Weapons Marshal will call out "range clear" or the equivalent, and wait momentarily for any
 responses.
 5.
 If all is clear, then the order "throw when ready" or the equivalent will be given.
 6.
 When finished, the throwers are to put down any weapons in hand, step back from the line and wait until
 the order to retrieve is given.
 September 2003

7.
 When all throwers are finished, the Thrown-Weapons Marshal will call "weapons down" or the equivalent
 and wait for compliance.
 8.
 When all weapons are down, then the Thrown-Weapons Marshal will give the command, "retrieve
 weapons" or the equivalent.
 Rules of the Line
 1.
 Side-arm throwing of weapons requires an adequate safe zone and the Marshal-in-Charge’s permission.
 2.
 Throwers must ask the Thrown-Weapons Marshal for permission before filling in on the line.
 3.
 All throwers on the line must throw from approximately the same distance.
 4.
 Throw only at designated targets.
 5.
 Do not throw until commanded to do so.
 6.
 Do not retrieve until commanded to do so.
 7.
 If "hold" is called, the thrower should put down his/her weapon(s) and step back from the line.
 8.
 The thrower should step aside or back once he/she has completed throwing.
 9.
 Do not throw weapons that have not been inspected.
 a.
 Any weapon that strikes or is struck by another weapon should be inspected by the thrower after
 each round of throwing.”
 10. Do not stand or walk behind throwers on the line.
 11. Just before each throw, look behind to ensure that it is clear.
 12. Do not swing weapons aimlessly or in a careless manner. Throwers should always be aware of what may
 be in the path of his/her weapon when it is swung.
 13. Be aware of sharp points and edges of weapons.
 14. Stay alert. Weapons can and will bounce back from the target if mis-thrown.
